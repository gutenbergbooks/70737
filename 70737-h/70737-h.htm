    <div>Transcriber’s Note:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The volume is a collection of three (apparently) already published
texts, each with its own title page, table of contents, and
pagination. The table of contents for all three is repeated
at the opening of the volume. All chapters are linked from the
‘mater’ table, but not from the redundant tables in the second
and third texts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Minor errors, attributable to the printer, have been corrected. Please
see the transcriber’s <a href='#endnote'>note</a> at the end of this text
for details regarding the handling of any textual issues encountered
during its preparation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The image of the blank front cover has been cleaned up and enhanced
with basic data from the title page, and, so modified, is placed in the
public domain.</p>

<div class='htmlonly'>

<p class='c001'>Any corrections are indicated using an <ins class='correction' title='original'>underline</ins>
highlight. Placing the cursor over the correction will produce the
original text in a small popup.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>PREFACE.</h3>
</div>
<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c015'>Instead of encumbering my small pages with
references to authorities and acknowledgments
of suggestions, I give notice in this place that I
am indebted to various authors and to some private
friends, not only for the information on which
the argument of this tale is founded, but for
lights respecting negro character and manners
which have enabled me to impart whatever truth
may be recognized in my slave personages. My
object having been to appropriate every thing,
properly authenticated, which could illustrate my
subject, I leave it to those who may be amused
by the employment to point out whence I derived
this argument, or that anecdote, or those elements
of scenery. At the same time, I cannot admit
that I have <em>copied</em>. The characters are intended
to be original, the arguments are recast, the descriptions
recomposed, and, to the best of my
knowledge, no part of the work is a mere republication
of what has been written before.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be objected that the characters for which
sympathy is claimed might have been made more
interesting, I reply that our sympathy for slaves
ought to increase in proportion to their vices and
follies, if it can be proved that those vices and
follies arise out of the position in which we place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>them, or allow them to remain. If the champions
of the slave had but seen how his cause is
aided by representing him as he is,—not only
revengeful, but selfish and mean,—not only treacherous
to his master, but knavish to his countrymen,
indolent, conceited, hypocritical, and sensual,—we
should have had fewer narratives of
slaves more virtuous than a free peasantry, and
exposed to the delicate miseries of a refined love
of which they are incapable, or of social sensibilities
which can never be generated in such a
social condition as theirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>That slaves cannot be made objects of attachment
is one argument against them in the mouths
of slaveholders. I have attempted to employ the
same argument in their behalf. That they command
our sympathies by their injuries alone, that
they claim our compassion by their vices yet
more than by their sufferings, is a statement the
force of which their adversaries cannot gainsay,
since they themselves have furnished us with the
plea.</p>

<p class='c001'>While endeavouring to preserve the characteristics
of Negro minds and manners, I have not
attempted to imitate the language of slaves.
Their jargon would be intolerable to writer and
readers, if carried through a volume. My personages,
therefore, speak the English which would
be natural to them, if they spoke what can be
called English at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>If I had believed, as many do, that strong
feeling impairs the soundness of reasoning, I
should assuredly have avoided the subject of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>following tale, since <span class='sc'>Slavery</span> is a topic which
cannot be approached without emotion. But,
convinced as I am, on the contrary, that the
reason and the sensibilities are made for co-operation,
and perceiving, as I do, that the most
stirring eloquence issues from the calmest logic,
I have not hesitated to bring calculations and
reasonings to bear on a subject which awakens
the drowsiest, and fires the coldest. Whether
the deductions which appear to me as clear as
day, are here made equally apparent to others, I
am unable to judge. I can only testify that it
has been my most earnest desire to make them
so, and to lead the minds of my readers through
the same course with my own. If I have succeeded,
they will find that the argumentative part
of the subject arises naturally from that which
appears at first sight to bear the least relation to
argument.</p>

<p class='c001'>While conversing directly with my readers, I
take the opportunity of thanking those friends to
my undertaking whom I cannot approach through
other channels, for the important assistance they
have afforded me, by furnishing me with books
and other means of information on the topics of
my course which yet remain to be treated. Of
all the kind offices which have been rendered to
me on account of this work, the one in question
is perhaps the most acceptable, because the most
widely beneficial.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span> <br /> <br /> SUNRISE BRINGS SORROW IN DEMERARA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The winter of the tropics is the most delicious
of all seasons of any climate to inhabitants of the
temperate zone. The autumnal deluge is over:
there is no further apprehension of hurricanes
for many months: the storms of hail are driven
far southwards by the steady north winds, which
spread coolness and refreshment among the
groves and over the plains. The sea, whose
rough and heavy swell seemed but lately to
threaten to swallow up the island and desolate
the coasts, now spreads as blue as the heavens
themselves, and kisses the silent shore. Inland,
the woods are as leafy as in an English June;
for there, buds, blossoms, and fruits abound
throughout the year. The groves of cedar and
mahogany, of the wild cotton-tree and the fig,
form an assemblage of majestic columns, roofed
by a canopy of foliage which the sun never penetrates,
while the winds pass through, and come
and go as they list. In the richest regions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.2'>2</span>this department of the globe, the cane-fields look
flourishing at this season, and coffee-plantations
clothe the sides of the hills. All inanimate things
look bright; and birds of gay plumage, and animals
of strange forms and habits add to the
interest and beauty of the scene in the eye of a
stranger.</p>

<p class='c001'>The brightest beauty, the deepest interest,
however, is not for strangers, but for those who
return to a region like this after years of absence,
like two travellers who were hastening,
one fine January day, to reach their long-left
home,—a plantation in Demerara. Alfred Bruce
and his sister Mary had been sent to England
for their education when they were, the one
seven, the other six years of age. They had
spent fourteen years without seeing their parents,
except that their father paid one short visit to
England about the middle of the time. Of him,
they had, of course, a very vivid recollection, as
they believed they had of their mother, of their
nurse, of the localities of the plantation, and the
general appearance of the country. They now,
however, found themselves so much mistaken in
the last particular, that they began to doubt the
accuracy of their memories about the rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>On landing, they had been full of delight at
the contrast between an English and a Guiana
winter. When they had gone on board, in the
Thames, a thick fog had hung over London, and
concealed every object from them but the houses
on the banks, which looked all the more dingy
for the snow which lay upon their roofs. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.3'>3</span>they landed, their native shores reposed in the
serene beauty of an evening sunshine. By as
bright a sunshine they were lighted on the next
day; and it still shone upon them as they approached
their father’s estate; but it no longer
seemed to gladden them, for they became more
and more silent, only now and then uttering an
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How altered every place looks!” said Mary.
“The birds seem the only living things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A servant, who had come to meet the travellers
with the carriage, reminded her that it was
now the time of dinner, and that in an hour
or so the slaves would be seen in the fields
again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not only that we see no people,” said
Alfred; “but the country, cultivated as it is,
looks uninhabited. No villages, no farm-houses!
Only a mansion here and there, seemingly going
to decay, with a crowd of hovels near it. I remembered
nothing of this. Did you, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c001'>No. Mary thought the face of the country
must have changed very considerably; but the
old servant said it was much the same as it had
always been in his time.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Something must have befallen the cattle,
surely?” observed Mary. “I never saw such
wretched, starved-looking cows in England.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The servant, who had never beheld any better,
smiled at his young mistress’s prejudices, and
only answered that these were her father’s cattle,
and that yonder mansion was his house.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a few minutes more, the long-anticipated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.4'>4</span>meeting had taken place. Alfred, sitting beside
his mother’s couch, with his beautiful little sister
Louisa on his knee; and Mary, with her father’s
arm about her waist, forgot all their expectations,
all their confused recollections, in present happiness.
Their only anxiety was for Mrs. Bruce,
who looked as if recovering from an illness.
They would not believe her when she declared,
with a languid smile, that she was as well as
usual; but her husband added his testimony that
she had never been better. Mrs. Bruce would
have been as much surprised at her daughter’s
fresh colour and robust appearance, if she had
not been more in the habit of intercourse with
Europeans than her daughter with West Indians.</p>

<p class='c001'>These young people were far happier this first
day—far more exempt from disappointment—than
many who return to the home of their
childhood after years of absence. Their father
was full of joy,—their mother, of tenderness.
Louisa was as spirited, and clever, and captivating
a little girl as they had ever seen; and her
perfect frankness and ease of manner showed
them how much liberty of speech and action
was allowed her by her parents, and how entirely
they might therefore reckon on the freedom which
is so precious to young people when they reach
what appears to them the age of discretion. Alfred
was as much surprised as pleased to observe
this spirit of independence in other members of
the family. The white servants, as well those
whom he had never seen before as the companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.5'>5</span>of his childhood, met him with an out-stretched
hand and a hearty welcome; and he
observed that they addressed his father more as
if they were his equals than his domestics. Alfred
immediately concluded that his most sanguine
hopes were justified, and that his father
was indeed no tyrant, no arbitrary disposer of
the fortunes of his inferiors, but a just and kind
employer of their industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary, meanwhile, could not help observing
the strangeness of the domestic management she
witnessed. The black servants whom she met
about the house were only half-clothed, and
many of them without shoes and stockings;
while her mother was as splendidly dressed as if
she had been going to a ball. The rich sideboard
of plate, and the whole arrangement of the
table, answered to her dim but grand remembrances
of the magnificence in which her parents
lived; but the house was in as bad repair, and
every apartment as unfinished, as if the mansion
was going to decay before it was half completed.
Having been told, however, before she left England,
that she must not look for English comfort
in another climate, she presently reconciled
herself to whatever displeased her eye or her
taste.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before Louisa went to bed, her brother asked
her if she would take a walk with him and Mary
in the cool of the morning; they remembered
the sound of the conch of old, and they wished
to see the people go forth to their work. Louisa
laughed heartily, supposing her brother to be in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.6'>6</span>jest; and Mrs. Bruce explained that nobody in
the house was up for many hours after the conch
sounded; but when it appeared that Alfred was
serious, Louisa, liking the idea of a frolic, promised
to be ready. There was no occasion, as
there would have been in England, to make any
proviso about the weather being fine.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a delicious morning, bright and balmy,
when the young people went forth. The sun
was just peeping above the horizon, and the families
of slaves appearing from their dwellings.
They came with a lagging step, as if they did
not hear the impatient call of the white man who
acted as superintendent, or the crack of the
driver’s whip. Their names were called over,
and very few were missing. The driver pointed
with his whip to the sun, and observed that there
was no excuse for sluggards on so bright a
morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you find the weather make much difference?”
inquired Alfred.</p>

<p class='c001'>“All the difference, sir. On a chill, foggy
morning, such as we sometimes have at this
season, it is impossible to collect the half of them
before breakfast; and those that come do little or
no work. They like the whip better than a fog,
for they are made to live in sunshine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Does my father insist on their working in
raw weather?” asked Alfred. “I should not
have thought it could answer to either party.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are so lazy,” replied the overseer,
“that it does not do to admit any excuse what
ever, except in particular cases. If we once let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.7'>7</span>them off on such a plea, we should soon hear of
more just as good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True enough,” thought Alfred, who, earnestly
as he had endeavoured to keep his mind
free from prejudice respecting the institution of
slavery, yet entertained a deep dislike of the
system.</p>

<p class='c001'>More than a third of the slaves assembled
were men and women of the ages most fitted for
hard labour, and of the greatest strength of
frame that negroes attain in slavery. These
brought with them their hoes and knives, and
each a portion of provision for breakfast. Having
delivered their vegetables to the women
who were to cook their messes, they were
marched off to their labour in the coffee-walks.
The second gang consisted of young boys and
girls, women who were not strong enough for
severe toil, and invalids who were sufficiently
recovered to do light work: these were dispersed
in the plantations, weeding between the rows of
young plants. Little children, with an old
woman near to take care of them, were set to
collect greens for the pigs, or to weed the garden,
or to fetch and carry what was wanted.
These formed the third gang; and they showed
far more alacrity, and were found to do much
more in proportion to their strength, than the
stoutest man of the first company. They alone
showed any interest in the presence of the
strangers. They looked back at Mary from time
to time as the old woman sent them before her
to the garden, and were seen to peep from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.8'>8</span>gates as long as Alfred and his sisters remained
in sight. The other gangs did not appear to
observe that any one was by; and such of them
as were spoken to scarcely looked at their young
master as they made their reply.</p>

<p class='c001'>The young people took a turn through the
walks, where the slaves were setting coffee-plants.
There could not be better materials to
work upon, a finer climate to live in, a richer
promise of a due reward for labour, than Alfred
saw before him; but never had he beheld employment
so listlessly pursued, and such a waste
of time. When he observed how the walks were
sheltered from the north winds, how thriving the
young plants appeared, how fit a soil the warm
gravelly mould formed for their growth, he
almost longed to be a labourer himself, at least
during the cool morning hours. But the people
before him did not seem to share his taste. At a
little distance he could scarcely perceive that any
of them moved; and when they did, it was in a
more slow and indolent manner than he could
have conceived. He had seen labourers in an
English plantation marking out the ground, and
digging the holes, and spreading the roots, and
covering them with so much despatch, that the
business of the superintendent was to watch that
they did not get over their ground too fast;
while here it took eight minutes to measure eight
feet from stem to stem; and as for laying the
roots, one would have thought each fibre weighed
a stone by the difficulty there seemed to be in the
work. He reminded Mary how, at this hour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.9'>9</span>the morning, an English ploughman leads forth
his team in the chill of a February mist, and
whistles, while eye and hand are busy marking
out his furrows; while, in this bright and fragrant
season, the black labourers before them
seemed to heed neither their employment on the
one hand nor the sunshine on the other. Quite
out of patience, at last, at seeing a strong man
throw down his hoe, when the hole he was preparing
was all but cleared, Alfred snatched up
the tool, finished the business, and went on to
another and another, till he had done more in
half an hour than any slave near him since sunrise.
Louisa looked on in horror; for she had
never seen a white man, much less a gentleman,
at work in a plantation; but when she perceived
that her sister looked more disposed to help than
to find fault, she ran away laughing to tell the
overseer what Alfred was doing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You look well pleased to have your work
done for you,” said Alfred to the slave; “but I
hope you will now bestir yourself as briskly for
your master as I have done for you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When Alfred looked at the man for an answer,
he fancied that he knew his face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Willy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, old Mark’s son, Willy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, old Mark is my father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, Willy, have you forgotten me as I
had nearly forgotten you? Don’t you remember
master Alfred?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes, very well.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.10'>10</span>“Is this Willy who used to carry you on his
shoulders?” asked Mary, “and who used to
draw my little chaise round the garden? He
was a high-spirited, merry boy, at——what age
was he then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Twelve when we went away. But, Willy,
why did not you come and speak to me as soon
as you saw me? You might have been sure
that I should remember you when you told me
your name.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy made no answer, so Alfred went on—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I find your father is alive still, and I mean
to go and see him to-day; for I hear he keeps
at home now on account of his great age. Can
you show me his cottage?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy pointed out a cottage of rather a superior
appearance to some about it, and said his
father was always within or in the provision-ground
beside it. His mother was dead, but his
two sisters, Becky and Nell, were at hand; one
was now in the field yonder, and the other was
one of the cooks, whom he would see preparing
breakfast under the tree.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was time to see the slaves at breakfast
before the same meal would be ready at home.
They assembled in the shade at the sound of the
conch, and each had his mess served out to him.
The young people did not wish to interfere with
this short period of rest, and therefore, after
speaking kindly to two or three whom they remembered,
they walked away. As they were
going, they met a few of the sluggards who had
not put in their appearance at the proper hour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.11'>11</span>and who sauntered along, unwilling (as they
well might be) to meet the driver.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What will be done to them?” asked Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They will only be whipped a little,” said
Louisa. Her sister stared to hear her speak so
lightly of being whipped.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, I do not mean flogged so that they cannot
work; but just a stroke or two, this way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And she switched her brother with the cane
she snatched from his hand. Seeing that both
looked still dissatisfied, she went on—</p>

<p class='c001'>“What better can they do in England when
people are late at their work? for I suppose
people sleep too long there sometimes, as they
do here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Her brother told her, to her great surprise,
that lazy people are punished in England by
having their work taken from them; there being
plenty of industrious labourers who are glad to
get it. She said there was nothing her papa’s
slaves would like so much as not to have to
work; but she had never heard of such a thing
being allowed, except on Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p class='c001'>In their way home they looked in on old
Mark, whom they found eating his breakfast,
attended upon by his daughter Becky, who had
come in from the field for that purpose. Mark
had been an industrious man in his day—in his
own provision-ground at least; and, in consequence,
he was better off than most of his neighbours.
His cottage consisted of three rooms,
and had a boarded floor. He had a chest for
his clothes, and at holiday times he was more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.12'>12</span>gaily dressed than any of his younger neighbours.
A few orange-trees and bananas shaded the
cottage, and gave the outside a somewhat picturesque
appearance, but the inside looked anything
but agreeable, Mary thought. The walls
were merely wattled and smeared with plaster;
and the roof, thatched with cocoa-nut leaves,
had holes in it to let out the smoke of the nightly
fire, which is necessary to keep negroes warm
enough to sleep. In the day-time they cook out
of doors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mark had never been very bright in his intellects
during his best days; and now the little
light he had was clouded with age. He was
easily made to understand, however, who his
guests were. He told some anecdotes of Alfred’s
childhood; and when once set talking, went on
as if he would never have done. He appeared
excessively conceited; for the tendency of all he
said was to prove his own merits. He related
how he had told the truth on one occasion, and
been brave on another; and how the overseer
had been heard to say that he made the most of
his provision-ground, and how the estimate of
his value had been raised from time to time.
Even when he gave instances of his master’s
kindness to him, it appeared that he only did so
as proving his own merit. What was yet more
strange, Becky had exactly the same taste in
conversation. She not only listened with much
deference to all her father had to say, but took
up the strain when he let it fall. The young
people soon grew tired of this, and cut short the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.13'>13</span>rambling narratives of the compliments which
Becky had received from white people in her
time. The conceit only took a new form, however;
at every word of kindness which either
Alfred or Mary spoke, both the slaves looked
prouder and prouder.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr13.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘What'>“What</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_13.7'><ins class='correction'>“What</ins></a></span> odd, disagreeable people!” exclaimed
Mary, as she turned away from the door; “I
always thought we should find slaves too humble,
servile; I hardly know how to treat them
when they are proud.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our slaves are particularly proud, because
papa has treated them kindly,” observed Louisa.
“Mr. Mitchelson laughs at us when we are tired
of hearing them praise themselves, and says that
if we used them properly they would never tease
us in that way; and I have heard that Mrs.
Mitchelson says to her daughter, ‘My dear, do
not look so conceited, or I shall think you have
been talking with Mr. Bruce’s slaves.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Louisa could not satisfy her brother as to why
slaves were made disagreeable by being kindly
treated. All she knew was, that slaves were
either silent and obstinate, like Willy, or talkative
and conceited like his father and sisters.
Alfred pondered the matter as he went home.
“My loves!” said their mother, in her usual
feeble voice, as the young folks entered the breakfast-room,
“how weary you must be with all you
have done! I would have had breakfast an
hour earlier than usual if you had been in; for I
am sure you must all be tired to death. Louisa,
love, rest yourself on my couch.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.14'>14</span>Louisa did so; and her brother and sister were
not believed when they declared they were untired.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When you know our climate a little better,”
said Mr. Bruce, “you will no more dream of
such long walks than the English of staying at
home all a fine summer’s day; which I suppose
they seldom do. But if you really are not tired,
Alfred, we will ride over to Paradise by and by.
I promised to take you to see your old friends,
the Mitchelsons, as soon as you arrived; and
they are in a hurry to welcome you.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span><br /> <br /> LAW ENDANGERS PROPERTY IN DEMERARA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>During a ride of several miles, Mr. Bruce and
his son were deep in conversation on the subject
of their affairs, which were in a state to cause
great anxiety to both, though the anxiety of each
differed much in character. Mr. Bruce had made
less and less by his plantation every year for
some years past; and he was now quite out of
heart, and full of complaints about the hardships
inflicted on himself and his brother planters, by
what he called oppression at home, and the competition
of other countries in their trade. He
was not a very clear-headed, though a good-hearted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.15'>15</span>man; and he had passed nearly his
whole life within the bounds of his own plantation;
so that he, as a matter of course, adopted
the views of planters in general, and joined in
the cry for higher bounties on West India produce,
and thought that the obvious way to relieve
West India distress was to obtain more exclusive
monopolies. He took credit to himself for being
even better entitled than most of his brethren to
complain of neglect and want of protection, as
he could not oppress his slaves in his turn, nor
endeavour to wrest out of them a compensation
for his losses in trade. He was too humane a
man for this. Thus believing that through the
cruelty of the government and nation at home,
and his own tender-heartedness, he was going to
ruin at a great rate, he was heartily tired of his
occupations, and ready to open his mind to his
son, and consult with him as to what should be
done.</p>

<p class='c001'>Young as Alfred was, he was deserving of
his father’s confidence, and far more likely to
offer him good counsel, when he should have had
a little experience, than any of the neighbouring
gentlemen who met from time to time to condole
with each other, and draw up memorials to Government.
Alfred had been in good hands in
England. He had been educated for the station
he was to hold, and so carefully instructed in
both sides of the great questions which were to
be before him through life, that there was no
danger of his being blind to all but what he chose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.16'>16</span>to see, or deaf to all but that which a certain
class chose to say. A fine estate in Barbadoes
was likely soon to lapse to him; and the knowledge
that he might at any hour be called upon
to act in the responsible situation for which he
had been educated, stimulated his study of his
duties and his insight into his prospects. He
did not, of course, make up his mind respecting
the details of the management of a plantation
before he had had the opportunity of observing
how the actual system worked; but certain broad
principles were fixed in his mind,—principles
which may be attested in any part of the world,
and which could not, he thought, be made void
by any connexion, or obscured by any aspect of
circumstances whatever. With these principles
full in his mind, he began, from the moment he
set foot on shore, to observe all that surrounded
him wherever he went, and to obtain information
from every class of persons to whom he could
gain access.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the present occasion, his father enforced
his complaints of West India adversity, by pointing
to the estates on either hand as they rode
along, and relating how they had changed owners,
and what disasters had befallen their various proprietors.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In England,” said he, “estates go down
from generation to generation, and a man may
have some pleasure in improving and cultivating,
in the hope that his children’s great-grand-children
may profit by and carry on his labours.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.17'>17</span>But here, no man knows whether his son will be
the better for all he does.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shall never prosper,” replied Alfred,
“till the system is wholly changed. Security of
property is one of the prime elements of prosperity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And that security can never be reached here,
son. As soon as a man thinks he is likely to do
well, there comes a hurricane, or a mortality
among his slaves, or, worst of all, an insurrection;
and perpetually, some thwarting measure
of our enemies at home. They need not envy
us our possessions here; for I am sure it requires
the patience of Job to be an India
planter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It must require more patience, father, than
I shall ever have, to hold property which is needlessly
insecure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you mean <em>needlessly</em> insecure?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I mean insecure through bad institutions.
I do not see at present how we are to guard
against hurricanes; but if I were convinced that
the other evils you mention could not be removed,
I would as soon go into Turkey and
hold my chattels at the pleasure of the sultan, as
be your heir. There is little to choose between
any two countries where there is not security of
property.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what I complain of, Alfred, is, that the
law does not secure us our property. If the same
law secures property in England, why does it
not here?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.18'>18</span>“Aye, there is the question, father. Is it not
clear that there is some flaw in our institutions
here which keeps them out of the pale of the protection
of law? Hurricanes and bad seasons
are answerable for a very small portion of our
distress; and to set against them, we have,
as with all our complaints we cannot deny, a
very extraordinary degree of protection from
government; though we cannot manage to benefit
much by it. By far the larger share of our
evils are such as law cannot remedy; and since
that law works far better in England than here,
it is plain that the fault does not rest with the
law.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure it is time we were looking into it,
son.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“High time, indeed: but people are unwilling
to look deep enough. If some of the pains that
are spent in providing expedients for the management
of property, were employed in examining
into its nature and tenure, we should be more in
the way of finding out what part of our system
is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear son, you really are too hard upon
us. Do you think we do not know what property
is?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do; because I think we hold a great deal
that does not belong to us. We can find that
out presently by going back to the beginning.
Taking the old pagan fable of the first pair of
human beings coming out of a cave, and supposing
that cave to be in yonder hill,—what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.19'>19</span>property,—what of <em>their own</em> would that man
and woman have on first coming into the day-light?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As soon as they chose to take possession,
they might have a whole continent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye; but before they took possession: as
they stood, hand in hand, at the mouth of the
cave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why nothing: for if the man said, ‘That
tree, bending with fruit, is mine,’ the woman
might say, ‘No, I want it;’ and neither could
give a reason for keeping it that the other might
not offer as well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True,—as to the fruit tree; but there is a
possession for each which each has a sound reason
for claiming. Suppose the man to say to
the woman, ‘The hair of my head is too short,
and I will have some of yours;’ or the woman
to say, ‘I have not strength enough in my
limbs, and you must work for me,’ has either any
property in the person of the other?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not. If the woman wants the
whole of her hair to shade her face at noonday,
and the man the whole strength of his limbs for
toil or sport, there is no reason why each should
not keep his own if he can. But most likely one
would be stronger than the other, and then possession
would be taken.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But not property established. If the man
cut off the woman’s tresses while she slept, the
hair would be no longer a part of the woman,
as strength of limb or faculties of sense: yet the
woman would still have the best title to it as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.20'>20</span>having been hers by original endowment. If
the woman, in her turn, bound the man’s feet as
he lay sick on the ground, and would not release
him till he had dug up as many roots for her as
she chose, would the man, therefore, or his
strength of limb, become her property?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not; for if he chooses to dig up
no more roots than he eats himself, she can do
nothing with him for her own advantage; and
the moment he can free himself he will. This
is merely force acting against force, and there
is no right in the case.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the woman has a right to cut off her
own hair, and the man to employ his own
strength, as long as he does not trespass on his
companion’s personal rights. Now, we see that
man has no natural property in man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor in anything else but himself,” interrupted
Mr. Bruce, “as you began by showing.
If you can prove that man has now any right to
property in the fruits of the earth, it follows that
he may in man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think not,” said Alfred. “The question
depends on what constitutes <em>right</em>. I think that
man has a conventional, though not a natural
right, to the productions of the earth; but neither
the one nor the other can sanction his holding
man in property. There may be a general agreement
that men shall take and keep possession of
portions of land; but there can never be a general
agreement that man shall be lord of man. If
the man and woman agree to take each a portion
of land, and not to interfere with one another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.21'>21</span>that agreement is a kind of law; and, in proportion
as it is observed, the property of each will
be secure. The same plan is pursued by their
descendants till they become too numerous to
make a mere agreement a sufficient security.
They then agree upon an express law, sanctioned
by certain punishments, which once more secure
to each the possession of what has now become
his property by common consent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such agreement and such law,” said Mr.
Bruce, “are essential to the general good; for
there would be no end to violence and fraud, no
inducement to improvement, no mutual confidence
and enjoyment, if the law of brute force
were to exclude all other law.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True,” said Alfred. “The general good is
not only the origin, but ought to be the end and
aim of the institution of property. With the
property in man which has been assumed from
age to age, the case is very different; and there
never was a time when that sort of property
could be secure, or established by general agreement,
or conducive to the general good. One
needs but to draw a parallel between the histories
of the two kinds of property to see this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Histories too long for me and my neighbours
to study, I am afraid, Alfred.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They may be very briefly sketched, father.
Capital held by the tenure of mutual agreement,—that
is, property in all things created subordinate
to man, has a perpetual tendency to increase
and improvement; and every such increase
is an addition to the good of society.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.22'>22</span>Cultivators of the land have made their portions
more and more productive, so as to maintain a
greater number of people perpetually. Inventions
have arisen, arts have improved, manufactures
have extended, till a far larger multitude of
people spend their lives in ease and enjoyment,
than would ever have been born if security of
property had been unknown. There is this conspicuous
mark of blessing on capital rightly applied,
that the more it increases the more it will
increase; while precisely the reverse is the fact
with that which is unrighteously made capital.
The more eagerly it is applied, the faster it
dwindles away; the more it is husbanded, the
more want it causes. Its increase adds to the
sum of human misery; its diminution brings a
proportionate relief.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, then, has there been slavery in all
ages of the world?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because the race, like the individual, is slow
in learning by experience: but the race has
learned, and goes on to learn notwithstanding;
and slavery becomes less extensive with the lapse
of centuries. In ancient times, a great part of
the population of the most polished states was
the property of the rest. Those were the days
when the lords of the race lived in barbarous,
comfortless splendour, and the bulk of the people
in extreme hardship;—the days of Greek and
Roman slavery. Then came the bondage and
villeinage of the Gothic nations,—far more tolerable
than the ancient slavery, because the
bondmen lived on their native soil, and had some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.23'>23</span>sort of mutual interest with their owners; but
it was not till they were allowed property that
their population increased, and the condition of
themselves and their masters improved. The
experience of this improvement led to further
emancipation; and that comparative freedom
again to further improvement, till the state of a
boor as to health, comfort, and security of property,
is now superior to that of the lord of his
forefathers. In the same manner, my dear sir, it
might be hoped that the condition of the descendants
of your slaves, a thousand years hence,
would be happier than yours to-day, if our slaves
were the original inhabitants of the soil they
till. As it is, I fear that our bad institutions
will die out only in the persons of those most
injured by them. But that they will die out,
the slave-history of Europe is our warrant; and
then, and then only, will the laws of England
secure the property of Englishmen as fully abroad
as at home. It is no reproach upon laws framed
to secure righteous property, that they do not
guard that which is unrighteous. Consider once
more who are the parties to the law, and the case
will be clear.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The government and the holders of the
property are the parties to the maintenance of
the law. The infringers of the law are the third
party, whom it is the mutual interest of the other
two to punish. So the matter stands in England,
where the law works comparatively well.
Here the case is wholly changed by the second
and third parties being identical, while the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.24'>24</span>treats them as being opposed to each other.
The infringer of the law,—that is, the rebellious
slave, being the property of—that is, the same
party with, his owner, the benefits of the compact
are destroyed to all. If the slave is not to
be punished, the owner’s property (his plantation)
is not safe. If he is punished, the owner’s
property (the slave) is injured. No wonder the
master complains of the double risk to his property;
but such risk is the necessary consequence
of holding a subject of the law in property.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You put me in mind, son, of old Hodge’s
complaint,—you remember Hodge,—about his
vicious bull. He thought it very hard that, after
all the mischief done to his own stock, he should
be compelled by the overseer to kill the bull.
Hodge owned a rebellious subject of the law.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; and Hodge was to be pitied, because
there was no making a free labourer of his bull.
But if he had had the choice whether to hold the
animal itself as capital, or only its labour, we
should have laid the blame of his double loss
upon himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must hear what Mitchelson has to say
on that subject, son. He has suffered as much
in his time as any man from troublesome slaves.
More than one was executed, and several ran
away while his last lease was current. His management
has changed, however, with the change
of times.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is he suffering, like every body else?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and I do not think he would have renewed
his lease if he had anticipated how prices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.25'>25</span>would fall. But he is a prudent man, and knows
how to mould his plan to differences of circumstance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who is his landlord?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stanley, who has lived in England these fifteen
years, you know. When he left this neighbourhood,
he let Paradise to Mitchelson for
ten years, at a thousand a year. There was a
permanent population of 300 slaves on the estate
at that time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If there were no more than 300 slaves,
sugars must have borne a better price than they
do now, to make it a good bargain to Mitchelson.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They averaged a gross price of 30<i>l.</i> a ton.
In addition to the rent, the other charges
amounted to about 20<i>l.</i> a ton; so that Mitchelson’s
net income was 1000<i>l.</i>”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And prices being higher than at present, he
was tempted to work his slaves to the utmost?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; but another part of the agreement
was, that the plantation, with all belonging to
it, should be appraised when the lease expired,
and that Mitchelson should pay up for any damage
it might have sustained, or pocket the value
of any improvement. He made his calculations
carefully, and found that it would hardly answer
to overwork his slaves considerably, as what he
would have to pay up for the sacrifice of life at
the end of ten years, would balance the present
increase of profits from making more sugar; so
he began moderately: but when prices rose to
40<i>l.</i> a ton, adding 2000<i>l.</i> to his income, it became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.26'>26</span>clearly his interest to increase his crop.
He determined therefore to add 100 tons to it,
even at an expense of life of 1000<i>l.</i> But it is
inconceivable what trouble he had after a time.
He can tell you as much as any man I know
about the inefficiency of the law for the protection
of property.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred made no reply; and there was a long
silence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well!” continued his father, “do not you
wish to know the end of Mitchelson’s speculation?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O! by all means. I was thinking what
would be the issue of it——at the end of time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At the close of the lease,—that is, five years
ago,—he willingly paid up for the slaves that
were under-ground, and got a renewal——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pray, did Stanley understand his system?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, I should suppose he did, having lived
here some years himself; but whether he did or
not, he found Mitchelson a good tenant, and that
was all that concerned him. No sooner was
Mitchelson set going again, than prices fell, and
fell, till they were only 25<i>l.</i> a ton.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank God!” cried Alfred.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay; I was really very sorry, independently
of my own stake in the market. It was truly
mortifying that it should happen at the beginning
of a lease. He made the best of it, however,
and saw that if he could not bring his crops just
to answer the rent and expenses, he might make
his profit at the end of the lease by a large claim
on the score of improvements. So he changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.27'>27</span>his system entirely, as you will see presently.
He raises food for slaves and cattle on ground
which he cropped before, feeds them well and
works them lightly, so that their numbers may
increase, and has even had his slaves taught
mechanical arts. He will have a pretty heavy
lump of profits, at the end of another five years,
if this state of things continues.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are told in England, father, that it is
the interest of planters to be humane to their
slaves, and the English are too apt to believe it.
I trust that you have never put your hand to
such a declaration since Mitchelson opened his
affairs to you; or that you explain it away like
an innkeeper I knew in England.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What did he declare?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A gentleman was giving him a lecture about
over-working his post-horses. ‘Bless me, sir!’
said the man, ‘do you think I know my own
interest in the poor beasts no better than that?
It is my interest, you see, to keep them in good
condition till the election, our great county
election, which comes on in three weeks.’ ‘And
what becomes of your horses then?’ ‘There
must be wear and tear at those times, you know;
but when that fortnight is over, there will be rest
for man and beast: for it is always a dead time
for posting just after an election.’ ‘Much good
may your tender mercies do your carrion!’ said
the gentleman, as I shall be tempted to say to
Mitchelson, if he tells me the story of his two
leases.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me just observe, Alfred, that I hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.28'>28</span>you will not admit any prejudice against Mitchelson
on account of your peculiar opinions about
property. He is the most humane man to his
white servants, the most indulgent parent, the
best——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father,” interrupted Alfred, “I assure you,
once for all, that when I hear of cruelties in the
gross, I execrate systems, not men. If I had
thought of individuals as I do of institutions here,
you would have already had my farewell, and I
should have been on board ship again for England
by this time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Patience! my dear boy, patience!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not with abuses, father; not with social
crimes. As much as you please in enlightening
those who are unaware of them: but with the
abuses themselves, no patience!”</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span> <br /> <br /> PROSPERITY IMPOVERISHES IN DEMERARA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Alfred was not at all disposed to gainsay what
his father protested about <a id='corr28.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Mr'>Mr.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_28.20'><ins class='correction'>Mr.</ins></a></span> Mitchelson’s
native kindliness of disposition. He remembered
the days when it was a common indulgence to
be carried about the grounds in Mr. Mitchelson’s
arms, or to sit on his knee, and listen to stories
of that England to which he was to go, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.29'>29</span>time or other. He ascribed this gentleman’s
treatment of his slaves, not to any love of tyranny
for its own sake, but to the grand error of regarding
human beings as property, operating upon
pecuniary interest. Though, therefore, it was
impossible to regard him with the same esteem
as if he had known how to respect the rights of
his fellow-men, Alfred was not disposed to visit
the sins of a system upon an individual who had
always treated him with kindness; and he therefore
met his old friend’s cordial greeting with
frank good-humour.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ladies were not at home; but they would
be in long before it would be necessary for the
Bruces to be turning homewards. Would they
step indoors and rest, or prolong their ride to a
once favourite seat of Alfred’s, where the pavilion
peeped out from among the trees? The gentlemen
were for proceeding, Alfred with the hope
of making some observations by the way, and
obtaining a distant view of the sea from the
verandah of the pavilion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gangs of slaves were at work in the cane-fields
through which they passed; but the apathy
with which they pursued their employment was
even more striking than on Mr. Bruce’s estate.
Alfred thought within himself how poor is the
purchase of a man. It is the mind that makes
the value of the man. It is the mind which gives
sight to the eye, and hearing to the ear, and
strength to the limbs; and the mind cannot be
purchased,—only that small portion of it which
can be brought under the dread of the whip and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.30'>30</span>the stocks. Where the man is allowed the possession
of himself, the purchaser of his labour
is benefited by the vigour of his mind through
the service of his limbs: where man is made the
possession of another, the possessor loses at once
and for ever, all that is most valuable in that for
which he has paid the price of crime. He becomes
the owner of that which only differs from
an idiot in being less easily drilled into habits,
and more capable of effectual revenge.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred lingered to watch the scene before him,
though the sun shed down a flood of rays that
would have been thought intolerable in England,
and though the doves were cooing in the shade
which his companions had already reached, and
humming-birds were flitting among the stems
like flying blossoms from some paradise that
better deserved the name than this. The overseer
was finding fault with one of the slaves, a
middle-aged man, of robust make and a more
intelligent countenance than most of his companions.
Alfred asked what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is lazy, sir, as usual: and as usual, he
says that he is a very bad labourer and never
was worth much to his master; but he can work
hard enough in his provision-ground. Nobody
brings so many vegetables and pigs to market as
Cassius.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How is this, Cassius?” said Alfred.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius only repeated what he had said about
the impossibility that he should do much work,
as he had always been a bad slave for labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this moment the gong sounded the hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.31'>31</span>of dinner. The overseer went away. Cassius
slowly walked off, as it happened, in the same
direction that Alfred was going. When he had
reached the shade, the slave looked behind him
to see that the overseer was not observing him,
and then quickened his pace almost to a run.
Alfred tied his horse to a tree, followed him, and
reached his provision-ground a very few minutes
after him. Cassius was already at work, digging
as if he were toiling for wages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred laughed good-humouredly as he asked
Cassius what he said now about the impossibility
of his working like other people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius put on a sullen look while he answered,
“You may ask my master, and he will tell you
that he has always had trouble with me. When
I was a youth, I never liked work, and I have
done less and less ever since. I am worth very
little to him. I have been whipped five times
since last crop, and I got into the stocks many
times last year. I eat more than my work pays
for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I wonder your master keeps you.
Don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder he puts such a high ransom upon
me. It is too high for such an one as I.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And are you working out your ransom,
Cassius?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am trying, sir. But I shall have eaten
more than it is worth before I get money to
pay it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now,” thought Alfred, “I understand the
meaning of this extraordinary humility, and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.32'>32</span>old Mark’s and Becky’s conceit, too,” he added,
as he remembered what had passed in the morning;
“they wish to enhance their own value,
from a suspicion that they will change masters
one of these days; and Cassius depreciates his,
because he hopes to get off with a lower ransom.
Dreadful! that human beings should rate their
own value according to the depth of another
man’s purse! They seem, too, to have no idea of
natural disinterested kindness; for Mark and
Becky took all the merit of my father’s little indulgences
to themselves. They seemed to think
they must be much better than their neighbour
Harry, because my father roofed their cottage
after the storm, while Harry was obliged to wait
till he could repair his himself. How this world
is turned upside down when slaves are in it!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, Cassius,” he said aloud, “I am not
your master, and I am not going to speak to
your master about you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not want to buy me?” inquired
Cassius, looking inquisitively.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not I. I have no estate, and am not likely
ever to want any slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What did you follow me for then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because I was curious to see how you
manage your provision-ground, if you really
cannot work. But do not attempt to deceive me
any more. I see you are afraid of having your
ransom raised. But you need not fear. I should
be too much pleased to see you obtain your freedom
to put any hinderance in your way. Make
me your friend, Cassius; and tell me how much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.33'>33</span>money you have earned, and how much more you
want; and where you mean to go if you <a id='corr33.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ge'>get</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_33.2'><ins class='correction'>get</ins></a></span>
your liberty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was going too straight to the <a id='corr33.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='poin'>point</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_33.4'><ins class='correction'>point</ins></a></span>.
Cassius had never had a friend since he was
parted from his father in his youth; and not remembering
much of the comfort of having one,
he was not ready with his confidence. He
looked suspiciously at Alfred, put on a lazy,
stupid look, and said nothing but a few words
without meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred’s next question, as it showed ignorance
of what everybody in the West Indies knows,
did more towards establishing a right understanding
than anything else he could have said.
It proved to the slave that the gentleman was
not practising upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is very fine soil,” was Alfred’s remark,
as he turned up a spade-full of earth; “and yet
I see nothing but plantains, and yams, and potatoes,
unless that patch of corn-ground is yours
too. Why do not you grow a few canes or
coffee-plants? or cotton, at least, would answer
your purpose better, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius grinned with some feeling deeper than
mirth, while he told the young ignoramus that
no slaves were allowed to grow any of the articles
their masters sell. This was clearly to guard
against theft; but it seemed hard that the labour
by which a ransom could alone be raised, must
be employed on productions which can never
become very valuable. Cassius laughed so long
at the idea of a slave growing canes or coffee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.34'>34</span>that Alfred began to regret the joke, for it did
not seem a very merry one to him. He could
and would have laughed in England to see a
cottager growing pine-apples on a quarter of a
rood of ground, because it would have been
ridiculous, and it would not be against any law.
Here the case was reversed; it was not ridiculous,
and it was against the law; and Alfred was
not disposed to laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How much time do you spend at work here,
Cassius? Two hours a-day?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius laughed again, and said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have not more than two hours for eating,
and day-sleep, and my ground, altogether.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed! you go to work at six and leave
off at eight for half an hour. You come home
again to dinner, and you have two hours then,
have not you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; one and a half: and sometimes I must
sleep, when I have worked at night, and when it
is very hot. We blacks grow cross if we do not
sleep in the day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, then, there is the evening. You leave
work at six, and there is time for much digging
before dark.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not when we have the cattle-feed to gather.
Sometimes we are at that till the night comes on.
It is so cold,” he continued, shivering at the
thought of it. “When our bundles of grass
are made up, we have to carry them far, and they
gather the dew, and it trickles down our backs,
while we wait to give them in. I had rather
work two hours more in the field by star-light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.35'>35</span>than gather grass when the ground is damp,
and be always scolded because the bundle is not
bigger.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why,” thought Alfred, “should cattle be
fed by human labour? Or, if grass must be
gathered, why not by people whose regular business
it shall be to do it by day-light, instead of
exposing those to the damp who are relaxed by
the heat of the day? I will see how my father
manages this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>During the whole time of conversation, as well
as in each pause, Cassius went on with his work
as if he had not a moment to lose. The hope
of ransom was the spring that animated him.
Everything about him testified to his eagerness
for saving. His bed of planks, with its single
mat and blanket, was his only furniture, except
a few eating utensils; he had but one wooden
trencher and two calabashes. Handsome as he
was, Cassius did not seem to have the personal
vanity of a negro, and on festival days was the
least gaily dressed of the group. He never took
a farthing from his hoard, and added to it on
every possible occasion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where do you mean to go when you have
paid your ransom?” asked Alfred, “or will
you buy land and remain? or be a free labourer
for your master?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I go, sir, but my mind is not settled where.
I hear there is a place over the sea, in my own
country, where we may live in the same way that
the whites live here; where we may grow sugar
and coffee, and trade as we like, and be rich, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.36'>36</span>even be governors—such as are most fit to be
so. One of our people got ransomed and went,
but we have never heard if he found such a
place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You mean Liberia?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, sir. Have you been there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; but I have been where I heard a great
deal about the place. If I were you, I would go
to Liberia as soon as I could—that is, if you
can labour. No man can prosper at Liberia, or
anywhere else, unless he exerts himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius stood erect, and pointed with a smile
to his grove of plantains, to his patch of maize,
to his plots of vegetables, flourishing in a clean
soil.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see, Cassius,” said Alfred, “what you
mean. I see that there was deceit in your way
of speaking of yourself before the overseer.
Cease to be a slave as soon as you can; but
while you are here, be faithful to your master.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Faithful!” exclaimed Cassius, looking full
at him. “I have never stolen his sugar—I
have never murdered his children—I have never
even listened to those who talked of burning his
canes or poisoning his cattle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“God forbid! but if you are not industrious—if
you do not speak the truth—you are not
faithful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should be unfaithful if I had ever promised
either; but I never did. Why should I
be industrious for him? And as for telling the
truth, I will do it when it helps me to get my
ransom; but if telling the truth hinders my being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.37'>37</span>free, I lie to myself when I tell the truth to my
master, for I have said to myself that I will be
free.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred had nothing to reply, for his principles
of morality had all a reference to a state of freedom,
and he had not learned yet to apply them
in circumstances which they did not suit. He
would have said beforehand, that there could be
no lack of arguments and sanctions for truth and
fidelity, the two most clearly necessary bonds of
society; but, at the moment, it appeared to him
that not one would apply. He inquired whether
there was no religious teacher on the estate, and
whether he did not bid them be faithful and
truthful?</p>

<p class='c001'>“There was one some time ago, and he
taught us a great deal. He told us what it was
to be Christians, and he made us Christians, and
said that our master and all his family were
Christians too. But he could not teach us long,
and he went away in a little while.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What prevented his teaching you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He could not make his stories seem true,
and whenever he read the Gospel, there was
something either to make us laugh, or to make
the overseer or our master angry. At last, he
preached one day about all men being brothers,
and about all being equal when they were born,
and that they should be equal again when they
were dead. He was disgraced and sent away
after that; and so he ought to be for preaching
what was false; for our master says, the blacks
never were and never will be equal with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.38'>38</span>whites; and we know that our master and the
overseer are not at all like our brothers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And yet,” said Alfred, speaking his own
thoughts, rather than thinking of the prudence
of what he was saying, “there were men once
who sold a brother as a slave into Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But he was not like us,” said Cassius; “for
God made him a great lord over his brothers
that sold him, and he let them go home again.
I am sure,” he continued, grinning as he spoke,
“if God made us lords over the white men, we
should not let them go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sorry,” said Alfred, “that your teacher
is gone, for it seems as if teaching like his was
very much wanted. When you get to Liberia,
however, you will learn these things faster and
better.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He then asked for water; and while Cassius
took down a calabash and disappeared to fetch
some, Alfred went on digging.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! ha!” said the slave when he returned,
“if I had a white gentleman to dig for me whenever
I am away, I should soon go to Liberia:
but I did not know that white gentlemen could
dig.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot help you much in that way, Cassius;
but here is what will do as well;” and he
put some money into his hand. Cassius leaped
high into the air, and was apparently going to
sing; but checked himself in a moment when he
saw the face of an old negro, a neighbour of his,
peeping through the fence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I must be going,” said Alfred; “but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.39'>39</span>shall never find my way to the pavilion. Will
this old man go with me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, sir; and Robert is merry and will talk
all the way.” So a ludicrous introduction took
place between the gentleman and the roguish-looking
old slave.</p>

<p class='c001'>They had not far to go; but Robert found
time to tell all his affairs to Alfred by the way.
He told him that he had a cottage and provision-ground
close by Cassius’s, and that he had a wife
as old as himself, and that they were too tired
to dig and plant when they had done work, so
that their ground produced but little; but that
their neighbour took care that they had enough,
and either gave them food or worked in their
ground on a Sunday, and that he piled their fire
for them every night. In answer to Alfred’s
remark, that Cassius was generous and kind in
doing all this, old Robert said in a careless way,
that Cassius was young and he and his wife old.
This reminded Alfred of the fact, that respect for
the aged is one of the characteristics of negroes.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was far from feeling any of this respect in
the present instance. Old Robert could not be
got to answer a question straightforward, or to
tell anything without contradicting himself
twenty times. He told fibs about his master and
Cassius and himself; had a story for every question
that was asked, the object of the story being
to find out how the gentleman would like to have
the question answered; and praised everything
and everybody that he supposed would be acceptable
to a white. Alfred soon grew tired of this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.40'>40</span>and bade him mind where he was going and leave
off talking: whereupon the old man began to sing,—not,
as Alfred would have liked, one of the
songs of his own land, in consideration of which
the cracked voice and antic action would have
been forgiven,—but an English hymn, which he
shouted through the wood, shaking his head,
clasping his hands and turning up his eyes,
which, however, never failed to warn him of the
boughs which straggled across the path, and
which he held aside that they might not incommode
his companion. When they came within
hearing of the pavilion, the chaunt became doubly
devout. Mitchelson shouted to him, with an
oath, to hold his tongue, to which he answered
with a flippant “Very well, sir,” and took his
way back again, muttering to himself as he hobbled
along.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred was surprised to find that Mrs. Mitchelson
and her two daughters had joined the
party in the pavilion. Fruit and wine were on
the table; the ladies reposed on couches and the
gentlemen lolled in their chairs, as English people
are wont to do in a hot climate. Alfred took
his seat by a window, where the spicy winds
breathed softly in, and whence he could look
over cane-fields glaring in the sun with coffee-walks
interspersed, over groves of the cotton-tree,
of the fig, the plantain and the orange, to
where the sea sparkled on the horizon, with here
and there a white sail gliding before the breeze.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr40.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘What'>“What</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_40.32'><ins class='correction'>“What</ins></a></span> luxury!” he exclaimed, “to sit in
this very seat once more, to look again on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.41'>41</span>landscape; to be regaled with such fragrance
as I have only dreamed of since my childhood,
and to feast on such fruit,” helping himself to an
orange, “as the English at home have little
more idea of than the Laplanders.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dear me!” said Miss Grace Mitchelson,
“I thought the English ate oranges. I am sure
there was something about oranges in what papa
read out of the newspaper about the theatre.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” said her sister Rosa, “did not they
throw orange-peel on the stage, papa?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred explained that the oranges which are
thought a great treat in England, are such as
would be thrown away as only half-ripe at Demerara.
His father looked pleased as he praised
one after another of the things in which a tropical
climate excels a temperate one. Mr. Mitchelson
stopped him, however, in the midst of
his observations on the fertility of the soils which
stretched from the height on which they sat to
the distant ocean.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fertile indeed they have been,” said he,
“and fertile many of them still are; but richness
of soil is not a lasting advantage like a fine
climate. It wears out fast, very fast, as I can
tell to my cost. If you had seen what yonder
cane-field produced when it first came into my
hands, and could compare it with last year’s crop,
you would be surprised at the change.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do soils become exhausted faster at Demerara
than elsewhere?” asked Mr. Bruce. “If
not, there is a poor prospect before our whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.42'>42</span>race. One would fear they must starve in time.
What do they say in England, son?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They say, sir, that soils used to be exhausted
there, and that, as a matter of course, they were
suffered to lie fallow from time to time; but I
believe sugar-planters do not like fallows.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We cannot afford them,” said Mitchelson.
“We must have crops year by year to answer
our expenses; and when we have short leases, we
must make the most of them, whatever becomes
of the land when we have done with it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“English farmers are so far of your opinion,
that the best of them say they cannot afford fallows;
but neither do they exhaust their soils.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How in the name of wonder do they manage
then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They practise convertible husbandry to a
greater extent than we planters ever dream of.
Wheat and barley exhaust the land like canes;
but by growing green crops in turn with grain,
and changing corn land into pasture, they renew
the powers of the soil, and may go on for ever,
for aught I see, till fallows are banished from
the land, and every rood is fertile in its due proportion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is all very well,” said Mitchelson;
“but it is no example for us. Sugar is our
staple, and sugar we must grow. We have little
use for green crops, and less for pasture.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the present state of things, certainly,”
replied Alfred. “The question is, whether it
might not answer to find a use for both? I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.43'>43</span>seen a calculation, and I mean to verify it as I
have opportunity, of the expenses and profits of
the management of such an estate as this by
methods of convertible husbandry. Such a system
involves many changes; but they seem to
me likely to be all advantageous; and I long to
see them tried.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He who made the calculation had better try,
son.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He means to do so, and I shall go over to
Barbadoes, some day, and see the result. He
will begin by making his slaves more like English
labourers——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is a foolish English fancy to begin
with,” observed Mitchelson.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Employing them,” continued Alfred, “in a
greater variety of ways than is common here,
and doing much of their work with cattle. Instead
of buying provisions, importing bricks, and
a hundred other things that might be procured
at hand, while the soil is all the time growing
barren as fast as it can, he will vary his crops,
thus raising food for man and beast; he will enlarge
his stock of cattle, thus providing manure
for his land, and butcher’s meat for his people;
his horses will graze for themselves instead of
the slaves doing it for them, and they, meanwhile,
will be making bricks and doing other things
worthy of men, while the work of cattle will be
done by cattle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very fine, indeed! and what becomes of his
sugar all this time?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A certain proportion of this estate will thus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.44'>44</span>he expects, be always kept in good heart for the
production of the staple on which his profits depend.
The profits of this portion and the savings
consequent on his management, will amount to at
least as much, at the end of ten years, as the profits
of growing sugar only; while his land will
be in as good condition as ever, the number of
his slaves increased, the quality of his stock improved,
and all in good train for going on to a
state of further prosperity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your friend is a proprietor, I suppose, Mr.
Alfred?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is; but he would follow the same plan
if he held a lease.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not he; at least if he once knew what
slaves are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He sees, sir, that whatever slaves may be,
they can do many things that cattle cannot do,
while cattle do the hardest part of slaves’ work
better than slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To say the truth,” said Mr. Bruce, “I have
often wished for ploughs and oxen, if I could but
have fed the cattle and employed my lazy slaves.
It did seem strange, when I came back from
England, to contrast the fine farm-yards and
dairies I saw there, with our paddocks, where
our half-starved beasts are fed with grass ready
cut.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It reminds me,” observed Alfred, “of a
child’s story-book I saw in England, with pictures
of the world turned topsy-turvy. There
was one of a mare perched in a gig, with her
master in harness. We might make a fellow to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.45'>45</span>it of a man cutting grass for the ox, after having
done the work of the plough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred had not forgotten that ladies were present
all this time, and was still further from supposing
that the conversation could be interesting
to them; but he was relieved from all consideration
for them, by having seen them long before
drop asleep, or shut their eyes so as to prohibit
conversation as much as if they were. When
the gentleman rose, however, to return to the
mansion, the fair ones roused themselves and
took each an arm to be conducted through the
wood. What was the subject of their conversation
is not recorded; but it was probably not
convertible husbandry, as the ladies of Demerara
hear quite enough in the gross of the troubles of
a plantation, to be excusable for wishing to avoid
the details of grievances which they are told can
be remedied by no other power than the English
government.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span><br /> <br /> CHILDHOOD IS WINTRY IN DEMERARA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Old Robert seemed to care so little for slavery
himself, that perhaps it was natural that he should
expect others to care as little; and that he should
laugh at his neighbour Cassius for working so
hard as he did in his provision-ground, and for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.46'>46</span>his general gravity of manner. Yet Robert
knew something of the worst treatment of slaves.
He was one who had survived the system of
over-working which high prices had occasioned;
and he showed that he remembered its hardships
by his present dislike of work and contrivances
to avoid it. Not a slave on the plantation was
so inventive of excuses, so rich in pretences, so
ready with long stories and jokes, all designed
to stave off work, as Robert, unless it were his
wife. None were at the same time so impatient
of idleness in others as they; and there was
not a hardship which they had suffered, not a
threat which had terrified them in former days,
not a punishment that it came within their power
to inflict, that they did not practise whenever
opportunity threw an inferior in their way. If
Robert had to lead a horse or drive an ox anywhere,
he was sure to beat and torment the animal
to the utmost by the way. If his wife found
a reptile in her dwelling, she killed it as slowly
as she dared, and as cruelly as she could. It
would have been well if their power had not been
extended beyond beasts, birds, and reptiles; but
it was not only shown, by their example, that
slavery is the school of tyranny, but, in the instance
of a poor little sufferer who lived with
them, that the most dreadful lot on earth is to
be the slave of slaves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Little Hester was only ten years old when she
was first put under old Sukey, according to the
custom by which novices in bondage are made
to serve a sort of apprenticeship to those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.47'>47</span>have been long under the yoke. Some humane
masters observing the facilities thus afforded to
slave-tyranny, have attempted to break through
the custom, but have found that, with all its
abuses, it is too much liked by the slaves to be
given up. The children prefer, at the outset,
being instructed by their own people; and the
elderly folks find pleasure, some in the exercise
of authority, and others in reviving their impressions
of their own young days of friendless
slavery. No one who knows how fond negroes
are of excitements of feeling, will wonder at their
seeking this melancholy enjoyment. There are
many instances where the pupil has been cherished
by a mother whose babe had been early
taken from her by death or violence; or by a
father who had seen his sons carried off to a
distance, one by one, as they became valuable
for their strength or skill. There are many more
instances, however, where the young slave’s lot
is more chequered than that of childhood in any
other part of the world; where kindness is as
capricious or rare as sunshine and warmth to
the blossoms of a Greenland meadow. Little
Hester seemed to wither fast under the treatment
of her master and mistress, as they called themselves;
but a tone of voice gentler than usual,
a mild word, a look of encouragement, would
revive her and strengthen her till the next gleam
came. There was no end to her troubles but in
sleep; and she never slept without dreading the
waking. Wearied as she was when she laid herself
down on her mat, she was apt to sleep as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.48'>48</span>long as the old people; and if she ever failed to
jump up when the gong sounded, Robert was
sure either to throw cold water over her, or to
touch her feet with a blazing piece of wood from
the fire, and to laugh at her start and cry. However
foggy the morning, out she must go to the
field, and do as much of other people’s work as
was put upon her by her master’s order. However
tired at noon, she must cook the mess of
vegetables, and feed the pigs, and run hither and
thither in the broiling sun. However dewy the
evening, she must stand in the grass and pluck
as much as she could carry; and, having carried
it, must be kept the last, as she was the youngest,
before she was relieved of her burden. She
dared not put it down and leave it; for, when
she once did so, she was flogged for not having
gathered her portion. When she came home
damp and shivering, she was thrust from the
fire; and creeping under her mat, lay awake till
the smoke hung thick enough round her to warm
her, and make her forget her bodily hunger and
her cravings of the heart in sleep. These cravings
of the heart were her worst misery; for she
had known what it was to be cherished, and to
love in return. Of her father she remembered
little. He had been executed for taking part
in an insurrection when she was very young; but
her mother and she had lived together till lately.
She had seen her mother die, and had stood by
the grave where she was buried; yet she awoke
every morning expecting to see her leaning over
her mat. She dreamed almost every night that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.49'>49</span>her arm was round her mother’s neck, and that
her mother sang to her, or that they were going
together to find out the country where her father
was waiting for them; but as often as she awoke,
she saw old Robert’s ugly face instead, as he
stood with his red and blue cap on, mocking
her; or heard both shouting the hymns which
she hated, because they were most sung on Sundays
when she was more unhappy than on
other days, being tormented at home, and just
as much overworked as in the field, without
any one to pity her or speak for her. Cassius
now and then took her into his ground and gave
her some fruit; and he had once stopped Sukey
when he thought she had beat the girl enough;
but his respect for the aged prevented his seeing
how cruel these people were; and, supposing
that the poor child would be a slave all her days,
he did not “make her discontented with her <a id='corr49.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='conition'>condition</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_49.19'><ins class='correction'>condition</ins></a></span>,”
as the overseer’s phrase was on all occasions
of interference.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, when Hester returned from her
morning’s work, she found the cottage empty,
and her dinner left on the table as if her master
and mistress had taken their’s, or did not mean
to return for it. The little girl danced to the
door to shut it, and then sat down on her mat to
eat her mess of vegetables and herrings. Almost
before she had done, she sank down asleep, for,
besides being overwearied as usual, the absence
of scolding tongues made such an unwonted
quiet in the dwelling, that she felt as if it was
night. She slept this time without fear of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.50'>50</span>roused by fire or water; for Robert was taking
his turn that day as watchman of the provision-grounds
in the neighbourhood; and on these
occasions the old man frequently took his dinner
in a neighbour’s dwelling, and his wife made
holiday also during the hour and a half she could
call her own. Hester therefore thought herself
secure till the gong should sound. She was
mistaken, however; for after dreaming that she
heard the dreaded voice calling her, and that she
knew it was only a dream, she felt her hair
twitched smartly, and started at Sukey’s shout
of—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t you hear your master calling you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sleep has no master,” said the poor little
girl, trying to rouse herself, and to remember
what time of day it was. “Is the sun up? Shall
I be flogged?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; you shall be flogged if you don’t run
this moment to the sick house and say that your
mistress is ill, and can’t work any more to-day.
Make haste, or you won’t be there before the
gong sounds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” said the child, looking timidly at
Sukey’s face, which showed more signs of mirth
than of pain; “they will not believe me, and
then they will flog me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Sukey said she should go down to the sick
house as soon as she could; and in the mean
time began to hold her body and writhe herself
about as if in great pain, while Robert mixed
something in a calabash as Hester had seen him
do before when he was lazy or bent on mischief,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.51'>51</span>and wanted to make himself ill for a short time
to escape work. The little girl still lingered,
saying—</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you would go with me now, the surgeon
would see that you are ill.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Sukey flying at her in a passion, and
Robert giving her a tremendous kick to hasten
her departure, the child fled away through the
wood at her utmost speed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Horner,” said the surgeon to the overseer,
when Hester had made her way through the
crowd of reputed invalids who surrounded the
door of the sick house, “what is the matter with
Sukey? Where was she this morning?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At her work, and so merry I was obliged
to make her hold her tongue. She was as well
as I am two hours ago, and is now, I’ll be bound
for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If she is not really ill, child,” said the surgeon,
“you shall be punished for bringing such
a story.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We’ll make you really ill, I can tell you,”
Horner proceeded.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child looked out wistfully, in hopes Sukey
was coming to tell her own story. She was rejoiced
to see Robert approaching with a solemn
face and a calabash in his hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sukey is very bad, very bad,” he protested.
“She can’t come; she can’t walk; but if the
surgeon will send her some physic, she hopes she
can go to her work to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he displayed the contents of his calabash—some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.52'>52</span>stinking black stuff which he vowed she
had just thrown up. The surgeon looked at it,
and then jerked the liquor in the old rogue’s
face. Robert whined and muttered as he shook
the perfume from his locks and wiped it from his
nose and chin, but bowed humbly when the surgeon
handed him a powder, and hobbled away
to avoid further question. The little girl had
already disappeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was moonlight when she returned from delivering
her bundle of cattle-feed. As she
passed slowly before the fence of Cassius’s
ground, it seemed to her that it was not in its
usual order. Another look showed her that the
soil was as rough in some parts as if it had been
dug up, and that the green crop was trampled
and the leaves strewn about as if a herd of oxen
had made their way through it. This might have
been the case, as the gate stood open; and Hester
stepped in to see. She started when she saw
that somebody was there. Cassius stood, leaning
his forehead against his low threshold, his
arms folded on his breast. The child remained
beside him for some minutes, hoping he would
turn round, but as he did not, she gently pulled
his jacket. He still took no notice. At last, a
long deep sob broke from him, and the child,
terrified at his agitation, ran away. He strode
after her, and caught her at the gate. He held
her with a strong grasp, as he cried—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who robbed my ground? You know, and
you shall tell me. Don’t dare to tell me a lie.
Who robbed me?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.53'>53</span>“Indeed, indeed, I don’t know. I did not
know you had been robbed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You did, you did. Why, don’t you see?”
he cried, as he dragged her from one plot to
another, “here is not a potato left, the yams
are all gone, and look at the plantain boughs
torn down. Everything is spoiled. I have
nothing to feed my pigs with. I have nothing
to carry to market. I have no more money than
I had a year ago. I shall not be free this year—nor
the next—nor the next—nor—I wish I
was dead. I shall never be free till then.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hester did not understand what all this meant,
so she remained silent and quiet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Child!” Cassius broke forth again, “do
you want to be free? Do you know anybody
that wants to be free?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know what it is to be free,” said the
child, innocently.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, nor ever will,” muttered Cassius. “It
was not you that helped to rob me then. It is
somebody else who wants a ransom by fair means
or foul.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You always gave me some fruit when I
asked,” said the child, “so why should I steal
it? And I have been in the fields ever since
dinner-time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And where have Robert and Sukey been?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Instead of answering, Hester looked round
for a way of escape. Her impatient companion
shook an answer out of her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They beat me sometimes when I say where
they <a id='corr53.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='are.'>are.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_53.33'><ins class='correction'>are.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.54'>54</span>“I will beat you if you don’t. No, no, I
won’t,” said Cassius, relenting at the child’s
tears; “I never beat you, did I?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, never; and I had rather anybody beat
me than you; but you won’t say that I saw
you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not if you tell me all you know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; I don’t know anything about your
ground being robbed; but my master can tell
you, I suppose, because he was watchman this
afternoon, and I think my mistress stayed from
work to help him, for she said she was ill.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And is she ill?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only the same as she always is, when she
does not like to go to the field.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius made no other answer to all Hester
told him, than to bid her go home, as it was so
late that Robert and Sukey would suspect her if
she stayed longer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Robert’s door was fastened when the child got
home; and when she called to be let in, her master
cried out, that she should be punished in the
morning for loitering; and that in the mean time
she might get supper and sleep where she could,
for he and Sukey would not get up to let her in.
The child began to wail, but was threatened with
a double flogging if she did not hold her tongue
and go to sleep at the door. She sat down on
the ground to consider whether she dared go and
ask shelter of Cassius, or whether she should lie
down on the litter of straw beside Robert’s dog,
and try to keep herself warm in that manner.
In a minute she heard a giggle from within, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.55'>55</span>suspecting her master might not be in bed, she
crept round to where the fire-light shone through
a chink, and looking in, saw both the old people
up and stirring. They seemed to be making a
plentiful supper, and little heaps of yams and
potatoes were lying about, which she had no
doubt came out of Cassius’s ground. It was by
this time so very cold, and the sight of a fire was
so tempting, that she determined to seek shelter
with Cassius, resolving, however, with a prudence
melancholy at her years, to say nothing of
what she had seen, and hoping that the spoils
would be put out of the way of discovery before
the morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius was not gone to bed, for he knew
there would be no rest for him this night. It
was a relief to him to have something to do;
and he bestirred himself to heap wood on the
fire, to get the child some supper, and to cover
her up warm. He also promised to beg her off
from the threatened flogging; so that the child
was unusually happy at the end of her day’s
troubles, and got rest by pleasanter means than
crying herself to sleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius laid his complaint against the watchman
as a watchman, as he had no means of
proving him to be a thief; for Robert and Sukey
had employed the night in removing all traces of
their spoils, which, however, filled their pockets
well the next market-day. Robert was slightly
punished for negligence on his beat, in the face
of all the many stories he had to tell of his unequalled
excellence as a watchman, and of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.56'>56</span>extraordinary difficulties which attended his duty
on that particular day. By dint of repeated and
pertinacious complaints, Cassius obtained some
ungracious and imperfect redress, the overseer
swearing at him for his obstinacy, and his master
complaining of the interference of the law
in his private property.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Mitchelson was perfectly correct in saying
that planters are subject to an evil which
their countrymen in England are free from, when
the law interferes with private property; but
that evil is chargeable upon the nature of the
property. It is another branch of the mischief
of the claimant and the infringer of the law
being opposed to one another in one sense,
while in another they constitute the same party.</p>

<p class='c001'>An injured slave appeals to the law; the law
decrees him redress; and the unwilling master,
while he cannot set aside the decree, complains—and
the complaint, though unjust, is true in
fact—that the law intermeddles in the disposal
of his private property.</p>

<p class='c001'>This fact brings in another consideration,
another instance of the reversal, in the case of
slavery, of all common rules,—that slaves are
better protected in despotic states than under a
free government. Where there is least scruple
about interfering with private property,—that is,
where there is a despotic magistracy,—there will
be the fewest considerations to oppose to the
impulses of humanity. Where the slave-holder
possesses the largest influence over public
opinion,—where he is a member of a colonial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.57'>57</span>assembly, or an influential elector of such a
member, or a possessor of any of those means
of keeping the magistracy in check, which exist
only under a free government,—there is the
strongest probability of the magistrate’s being
tempted to stifle those complaints which he
knows cannot be urged elsewhere if disallowed
by him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the days of Augustus, one Vidius Pollio, in
the presence of the emperor, ordered one of his
slaves, who had committed some slight fault, to
be cut in pieces and be thrown into his fish-pond
to feed the fishes. The emperor thereupon
commanded him to emancipate, immediately,
not only that slave, but all the others that
belonged to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these days, no potentate can thus dispose
of the property of a Briton; and it is well. But
it is clearly just that while the Briton abjures
despotic rule, he should hold none under him in
such subjection as to need the interference of
despotic vengeance for the redress of their
wrongs.</p>

<p class='c001'>To attempt to combine freedom and slavery is
to put new wine into old skins. Soon may the
old skins burst! for we shall never want for a
better wine than they have ever held.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span> <br /> <br /> NO HASTE TO THE WEDDING IN DEMERARA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>About this time there was occasion for a family
consultation in old Mark’s cottage; and it took
place one day instead of the afternoon sleep, to
which the family regularly composed themselves
when dinner was done, except at such busy
seasons as deprived them of the indulgence
necessary to negroes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Old Mark had talked on, as usual, all dinner
time, his children listening to him as if he had
been an oracle, except Nell, who, for once,
seemed inattentive to her father, and full of her
own thoughts. Becky observed upon this as
soon as there was a pause, saying that she
supposed Nell had had some scolding, or was
likely to be punished for having spoiled some of
her work that morning. Willy said that it was
a different sort of speech that Nell had had made
to her; and he laughed. Becky’s face clouded
over at once; for, much as she had to say about
the compliments paid to herself, she knew that
Nell had far more.—Nell was handsomer and
more spirited than Becky; and they were about
equally vain; so that, till they had each a lover,
there were frequent quarrels between the sisters;
and even since their rivalry had ceased, Becky
was subject to pangs of envy as often as she
heard of her sister being more admired than
herself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.59'>59</span>Nell now explained that their neighbour
Harry had made up his mind at last to marry her
if she chose; and she only waited to know what
her father would say.</p>

<p class='c001'>He shook his head, and asked how long it was
since there had been a slave marriage on the
estate. None of the young people remembered
one on their plantation, but there had been one
in the neighbourhood within ten years. Mark
remembered that he had been happier with his
wife than before he married her; and from his
own experience, would have recommended his
daughters to settle; but more and more difficulties
had arisen since his young days about the
consequences of slaves’ marriages, and he was
afraid to advise the step; especially as Willy was
altogether against it, out of regard to his sister,
and Becky, because her own lover would not promise
to marry her. Willy did not speak for a long
time, while his father went on prosing about how
everybody would talk, and stare, and wonder,
and whether it would please or displease their
master, and lastly, whether Nell would be happier
or less happy after it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you will marry too, Willy——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I won’t marry,” said Willy, doggedly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your master values you, and so it is most
likely he would not be angry; and it would
make people wonder less about Nell.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They might well wonder at me. No, father;
I saw what came of the marriage in the next
plantation. It was just like no marriage.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.60'>60</span>“But there is a law now to make our marriages
as lawful as white people’s.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To bind a man and his wife together as
long as they are both slaves; but if the man gets
free, the woman cannot go with him. His money
is not hers because it is his; and if anybody
buys her, her husband may not follow her unless
his master allows it. They cannot do their
children any good. They cannot make them
free, nor save them from labour, nor help them
to get justice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there is a pleasure in living with a wife
in a cottage, and in sowing corn together, and
in making the fire for one another, and in having
her to talk to, and to dance with, when holidays
come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy observed that all this might be done
without being married, and was done by everybody
on the plantation, who would have married
if the civil rights of marriage had been allowed
to them as to the whites.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you do every thing for yourself, Willy.
You want nobody to sing to you, or to dance
with you, or to go to market with you. You
want nobody to love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I love you, father, and Nell, and Becky.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I shall die soon, and Nell will marry,
and Becky loves her lover. It is time you
should find somebody else to love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The time is past, father. I began to
love Clara once, just before she died; and
while I was forgetting my sorrow for her, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.61'>61</span>learned by what I saw, never to love anybody
else.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, Willy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because a black must be first a slave and
then a man. A white woman has nobody to
rule her but her husband, and nobody can hurt
her without his leave: but a slave’s wife must
obey her master before her husband; and he
cannot save her from being flogged. I saw my
friend Hector throw himself on the ground when
his wife was put in the stocks; and then I swore
that I would never have a wife.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But think of Hector’s children, Willy. O,
you do not know the pleasure of hearing one’s
little children laugh in the shade, when the sun
makes one faint at noon! It is like a wind from
the north. And to let them sleep under the
same mat, and to see them play like the whites,—and
then their master pats their heads sometimes
when they follow him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Like dogs,” said Willy, “that as often get a
kick as a kind word. When I see little children
as clever and as merry as whites, I take them up
in my arms and love them; but when they are
carried away where their father shall never see
them again, or when their mothers look sad to
find them growing as stupid as we are, I am glad
that I am not their father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Becky!” said her father, “are these the
reasons that your lover will not marry you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Becky made no answer; for the fact was she
knew nothing more than that he thought there
was no occasion.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.62'>62</span>“Willy!” said the old man again, “if you
will not love nor marry here, you will try to go
somewhere where you can be a man and a
husband without being a slave. You work in
our ground. Is it that you may be free when I
am dead?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, father, I shall not try to be free.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why then do you sow corn and dig our
ground for us? If you get money, why will you
not pay it to be free?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I sow corn that you may have as good food
as when you were young and could dig like me.
I get money because others do so; but, unless it
were many times as much, it does little good to
me, for I shall never be free. The Englishmen,
over the sea, tell us that they wish us to be free,
and bid us try to buy our ransom; and when we
have nearly done so, they put a higher price
upon us, and laugh when we give up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How can people so far off raise our price?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They raise the price of sugars because our
masters ask them, and then our masters raise our
price. Hector once hoped to buy his freedom;
and it made him happy to see his master look
sad, because then he knew that his master could
not sell his sugar, and did not want his slaves so
much, and Hector hoped that no more sugar
would be sold till his master had taken his
ransom and let him go. But one day the overseer
told him that his ransom was too low and he
must not go yet. It was because his master
wanted to make sugar again; and he wanted to
make sugar because the people in England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.63'>63</span>pitied our masters, and made sugar dearer that
they might be rich.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If the whites in England pitied us,” said
Nell, “they would make sugar cheaper that we
might be free.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Till they do,” said Willy, folding his arms,
“I will be as I am, I will work no more than I
cannot help. I will sleep all I can, that I may
forget. I will love my father till he dies, and
Nell and Becky till they have husbands that
will love them more than I. Then, since I cannot
love, I will hate; and I will call to the hurricane
to bury me under my roof and set me
free.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will love our young master, Willy? He
did not forget you while he was beyond the sea,
and he is a kind master now he has come back.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did not forget him,” said Willy. “I remember
how he made me play with him when
we were both boys; but I did not love him then,
because he was oftener my master than my play-fellow;
and I do not love him now, because he
will be my master again. Don’t ask me, father,
to love anybody. Slaves cannot love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy looked round for his sisters; but Nell
was gone to Harry’s cottage to tell him she would
marry him, thus taking advantage of her brother’s
mention of husbands for herself and Becky.
Becky had followed to see how Harry would
take the communication. So Willy threw himself
down on his mat as if going to sleep, while his
father, whose ideas had been carried back to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.64'>64</span>young days, sat at the door of the hut, singing to
himself the song with which he had courted his
long-buried wife.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What can be the matter with Mitchelson?”
said Mr. Bruce one day, when his son was riding
with him. “See what a hurry he is in, and how
vexed he looks! He is in a downright passion
with his favourite mare.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Mitchelson smoothed his countenance a
little as he approached, but still looked sorely
troubled. The cause of his vexation was soon
told. His mill-dam had burst, and been carried
away at a very critical season, and nothing could
repay the loss of time before it could be restored.
Time was everything in such a case.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how long will it take to repair it?” inquired
Alfred.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Three months,—three precious months, I
expect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it possible?” said Alfred. “I cannot
think it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You judge of everything, son, as if this were
England,” said Mr. Bruce. “Our people do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.65'>65</span>turn off work like the labourers you have been
accustomed to see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Mitchelson must know best, of course,”
replied Alfred; “but does your surveyor, or
contractor, or whoever he be, bid you wait three
months?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will when he hears the story which I
am now on my way to tell him. I can’t stop,
so good morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me go with you,—may I?” said Alfred.
“I like to see and hear everything I can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Mitchelson professing himself glad of his
company, Alfred turned his horse’s head in search
of the contractor.</p>

<p class='c001'>While this important personage was musing
and calculating, Mr. Mitchelson kept urging,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Time, you know, is everything. Anything
to save time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred modestly suggested that it would be
worth trying the experiment of making the slaves
as much like English labourers for the occasion
as possible. Mitchelson laughed at the idea; but
asked the contractor how long the repairs would
take if the number of slaves he meant to employ
were English labourers?</p>

<p class='c001'>“From twelve to fifteen days, I should
think.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how long if they work like slaves in
general?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Probably sixty days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Somewhat under the time I fixed in my own
mind. You know, Alfred, I said three months
at a round guess.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.66'>66</span>“I wish—I wish——” Alfred kept saying,
half to himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you wish?” said the contractor,
who understood the value of labour, and suspected
that he and Alfred were of the same way
of thinking on that class of subjects; “what is
it you wish?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps Mr. Mitchelson will laugh at me for
the notion; but I wish he would let you and me
manage this affair, as we shall agree; you
pledging yourself for the cost, and I for the time.
You shall arrange the work, and I will manage
the slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In that case,” replied the contractor, “I would
engage to finish the repairs in twenty days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Twenty days!” cried Mitchelson. “My
dear sir, you were more right in saying sixty.
You will not do it under sixty. But you may
try. I give you <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>carte blanche</i></span>; and to leave
you perfectly free, I will go away. I want to
go into Berbice, and I may as well do it now
while our regular business is stopped.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The other contracting parties were by no means
sorry for this. Alfred’s partner returned with him,
and operations were commenced immediately.</p>

<p class='c001'>The main feature of Alfred’s plan was to pay
wages. He collected the men, told them what
they had to do and expect, promised them warm
clothing in case of their working early and late,
showed them the ample provision of meat, bread,
and vegetables he had stored at hand, marched
them off, only staying behind to forbid the overseer
to come within sight of the mill-dam, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.67'>67</span>from that time never left the spot till the work
was finished. Horner was very angry, and full
of scorn and evil prognostications; but nobody
cared except the poor women and children, upon
whom he vented his ill-humour as long as he was
deprived of his dominion over the able-bodied
labourers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Bruce arrived when the work was half
done, to see how his son’s speculation was likely
to succeed. As he approached, he was struck
with the appearance of activity so unusual in
that region. The first sound he heard was a
hum of voices, some singing, some talking, some
laughing; for negroes have none of the gravity
of English labourers. When they are not sullen
they are merry; and now they showed that talk
and mirth were no hinderance to working with
might and main. Cassius toiled the hardest of
all, and was the gravest; but he was happy: for
this was an opportunity of increasing the fund
for his ransom which he had little dreamed of.
Alfred was talking with him, and lending a
hand, as he did continually to one or another,
when his father appeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bravo! son,” cried Mr. Bruce, as Alfred
ran to meet him. “You and your partner are
doing wonders, I see. Will you fulfil your contract?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very easily, sir, if weather remains favourable—(O!
I forgot there was no fear of bad
weather)—and if Mr. Mitchelson keeps out of
the way, so that I may keep Horner and his
whip out of the way also till we have done. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.68'>68</span>family are all absent, you see; but I will step in
with you while you rest yourself. I was surprised
to find the ladies gone too when I arrived.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mitchelson always takes them with him when
he is absent for more than a few hours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred thought within himself that he should
not have suspected the gentleman of being so
very domestic.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But come,” said Mr. Bruce, dismounting
and fastening up his horse, “show me the secrets
of your management. What are these barrels,
and whence comes this savoury smell?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“These barrels hold beef and pork, sir; and
the savour is from the cooking in yonder
hut.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what is your allowance per man?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As much as he chooses to eat. We should
get little work done if we gave each labourer
weekly no more than two pounds of herrings and
eight pounds of flour, with the vegetables they
grow themselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The law pronounces that to be enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what says the law of nature? You and
I do no hard work; and could we keep ourselves
sleek and strong on such a supply of food?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Negroes do not want so much as whites.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is a good reason for their having as
much as they do want. Our people here are not
troubled with indigestion, as far as I can perceive.
What do you think of our warm
jackets?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot imagine how they can support the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.69'>69</span>heat in such clothing. No wonder they throw
them aside.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are only for morning and evening.
The people scarcely seem to heed the morning
fogs while they wear their woollens; and we
make them put them on again when the sun
sets——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you mean that they work after sunset of
their own accord?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We have difficulty in making them leave off
at nine o’clock. They like to sing to the moon
as they work; and when they have done, they
are not too tired for a dance. Father, you would
more than pay for a double suit of clothing to
your slaves by the improvement in their morning’s
work; and yet I believe you give them more
than the law orders.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes. One hat, shirt, jacket, and trowsers,
cannot be made to last a year; and the clothing
that the slaves buy for themselves is more for
ornament than warmth. I do not know how
the overseer clothes them, but I have always desired
that they should have whatever was necessary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred said to himself that the overseer’s notions
of what was necessary might not be the
best rule to go by.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Bruce meanwhile was looking alternately
at two gangs of slaves at work after a rather different
manner. He was standing on the confines
of two estates; and, in a field at a little distance,
a company of slaves was occupied as usual; that
is, bending over the ground, but to all appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.70'>70</span>scarcely moving, silent, listless, and dull.
At hand, the whole gang, from Cassius down to
the youngest and weakest, were as busy as bees,
and from them came as cheerful a hum, though
the nature of their work rather resembled the occupation
of beavers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Task-work with wages,” said Alfred, pointing
to his own gang; “eternal labour, without
wages,” pointing to the other. “It is not often
that we have an example of the two systems before
our eyes at the same moment. I need not
put it to you which plan works the best.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is indeed very striking; but what can we
do? We must hold labour as capital,—to put
the question in the form you like best,—for our
modes of cultivation require continuous labour.
We cannot begin our tillage, and leave off and
begin again, as may suit the pleasure of our
labourers. We must have labour always at command.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Undoubtedly; and which has the most labour
at command at this moment,—Mitchelson,
or the owner of those miserable drones yonder?
And what is to prevent Mitchelson from having
this efficient labour always at command if he uses
the same means that have secured it now? Labour
is the product of mind as much as of body;
and, to secure that product, we must sway the
mind by the natural means,—by motives. A
man must learn to work from self-interest before
he will work for the sake of another; and labouring
against self-interest is what nobody ought
to expect of white men,—much less of slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.71'>71</span>“I am quite of your opinion there, and, in
consequence, make my slaves as comfortable as
I can. Of course, every man, woman, and child,
would rather play for nothing than work for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then surely it is best for all parties to make
the connexion between labour and its reward as
clear as possible. I doubt whether any slave
believes that his comforts depend on the value
of his work. At any rate, he often sees that
they do not. And this difficulty will for ever attend
the practice of holding labourers as fixed capital.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the maintenance of their labour, son, is
reproducible as much as if they were free.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is; in the same way as the subsistence of
oxen and horses. In both cases it is consumed
and reproduced with advantage: but cattle are
fixed capital, and so are slaves. But slaves differ
from cattle, on the one hand, in yielding (from
internal opposition) a less return for their maintenance;
and from free labourers, on the other,
in not being acted upon by the inducements
which stimulate production as an effort of mind
as well as body. In all three cases the labour is
purchased. In free labourers and cattle, all the
faculties work together, and to advantage; in
the slave they are opposed: and therefore he is,
as far as the amount of labour is concerned, the
least valuable of the three.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And too often as to the quality of his labour
also, son. A slave does some few things for us
that cattle and machinery could not do; but he
falls far short of a free labourer in all <a id='corr71.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='respects'>respects.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_71.33'><ins class='correction'>respects.</ins></a></span>
Our slaves never invent or improve.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.72'>72</span>“Why should they? No invention would
shorten their toil, for they do no task-work. No
improvement does them any good, for they have
no share in the profits of their labour. They <em>can</em>
invent and improve,—witness their ingenuity in
their dwellings, and their skill in certain of their
sports; but their masters will never possess their
faculties, though they have purchased their limbs.
Our true policy would be to divide the work of
the slave between the ox and the hired labourer;
we should get more out of the sinews of the one
and the soul of the other, than the produce of
double the number of slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have sometimes wondered,” said Mr.
Bruce, “whether we do not lose on the whole
by forbidding our slaves to raise exportable produce
in their own grounds. They, being better
adapted than ourselves to the soil and climate,
might discover and practise modes of tillage from
which we might gather many useful hints, which
might more than repay what we should lose by
their thefts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What you would lose by theft is a mere
trifle,” answered Alfred, “in the account of the
cost of a negro. If they were free labourers,
thieving as fast as opportunity would allow,
(which being free labourers, they would not,)
your blacks would cost you little in comparison
of what they do now without thieving.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I took pains to calculate the cost of a
slave before I left England; and I have had the
means of proving my calculation by the experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.73'>73</span>of my friend yonder, the contractor, who
has had more opportunity than most people I
know of mastering both sides of the question.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Does he speak of slaves newly imported, or
of those born and bred on the estate? for that
makes a vast difference.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We have reckoned both. Those imported
were, of course, by far the dearest; for, in addition
to the usual cost, we had to defray the expenses,
in life and money, of wars on the coast
of Africa, and of conveying them across the ocean,
the loss under the seasoning when they arrived,
and the revenue to the African trader; and, after
all, they are worth less than those bred on the
spot, from being unacquainted with the language,
and unused to the kinds of labour in which they
were to be employed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I never was one to advocate the importation
of slaves; it is so clear that the expenses of their
rearing are much less than those attending their
transport. But I really do not think the cost of
maintaining slaves can be greater than that of
free labourers. They must both eat and drink,
you know, and be clothed and housed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True, father; and the question therefore is,
whether their maintenance can be managed the
more economically by their own contrivance
when they have an interest in saving, or by their
master’s pinching them when they have an interest
in wasting his property. The free labourer
has every inducement to manage his field or other
possession frugally, and to husband whatever
produce he may obtain. You need only look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.74'>74</span>into the state of our slave acres, to see how different
the case is there. The cultivation is negligently
performed, the produce stolen or wasted,
so that we reap scarcely a third of the natural
crop. In both cases, the master pays the subsistence
of the labourer, but the slave-owner
pays in addition for theft, negligence, and
waste.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well but, Alfred, give me the items. Tell
me the value of a healthy slave at twenty-one?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe his labour will be found at least 25
per cent. dearer than free labour. From birth to
fifteen years of age, including food, clothing, life-insurance,
and medicine, he will be an expense;
will not he?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes. The work he does will scarcely pay
his insurance, medicine, and attendance, leaving
out his food and clothing; but from fifteen to
twenty-one, his labour may just defray his expenses.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very well; then food and clothing for fifteen
years remain to be paid; the average cost of
which per annum being at the least 6<i>l.</i>, he has
cost 90l. over and above his earnings at twenty-one
years. Then if we consider that the best
work of the best field-hand is worth barely two-thirds
of the average field-labour of whites,—if
we consider the chances of his being sick or
lame, or running away, or dying,—and that if
none of these things happen, he must be maintained
in old age, we must feel that property of
this kind ought to bring in at least 10 per cent.
per annum interest on the capital laid out upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.75'>75</span>him. Whether the labour of a black, amounting
to barely two-thirds of that of a white labourer,
defrays his own subsistence, his share of the expense
of an overseer and a driver, and 10 per
cent. interest on 90<i>l.</i>, I leave you to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not, son, even if we forget that
we have taken the average of free labour, and the
prime of slave labour. We have said nothing of
the women, whose cost is full as much, while
their earnings are less than the men’s. But you
overlook one grand consideration;—that whites
cannot work in the summer time in this climate
and on this soil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is only saying ‘free black’ instead of
‘white.’ The tenure of the labour is the question,
not the colour of the labourers, as long as
there is a plentiful supply of whichever is wanted.
Only let us look at what is passing before our
eyes, and we shall see whether negroes working
for wages, or even under tribute, are not as good
labourers as whites.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have often meditated adopting the plan of
tribute, Alfred, since times have gone badly with
me; but it is difficult on a coffee plantation. If
I were in Brazil, the proprietor of a gold mine,
or at Panama, the lord of a pearl-fishery, I would
adopt their customs. I would supply my slaves
with provisions and tools, and they should return
me a certain quantity of gold or pearls, and keep
the surplus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is one way of making them work by
fair means, father. It is an important approach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.76'>76</span>to emancipation, as I believe it was found in
Russia. It seems, too, an excellent preparative
for a state of freedom; and surely such a preparative
would never have been adopted, and would
not have been allowed to proceed to entire emancipation,
if such comparative freedom had not
been advantageous to the master as well as the
slave. It is a strong argument, brought forward
by slave-holders, in favour of emancipation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the plan could not be tried on a coffee
plantation, son—that is the worst of it. If we
lived in the neighbourhood of a large town, I
would attempt it on a small scale. Some of
my slaves should let their labour, paying me a
weekly tribute, and keeping whatever they earned
over and above. This is done in places south
and west of us on this continent, as a Spanish
friend of mine was telling me lately.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Suppose we try task work instead, father?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have no other objection than this, son.
If the experiment did not answer, there would
be no getting the slaves back to the present
system.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A strong argument against the present system,
father; but not the less true for that:
suppose then we try with some new employment.
If the blacks are as stupid as they are thought to
be here, we need not fear their carrying the
principle out any farther than we wish. Suppose
we make bricks by task-work. Why should we
import them, when we have abundance of brick
clay on the estate and labour to spare?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.77'>77</span>“It has been found to answer better to import
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who says so?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Herbert, my old neighbour. He had
not straw enough, to be sure, growing, as he
does little besides sugar.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah; the bounty is all in all with these sugar-growers,
father. They keep their eye fixed on
that bounty, and give no other article of production
a fair chance. Besides, I suppose he did not
try task-work?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not he. But consider, Alfred, how very
little the freight is; and then, there is the fuel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fuel is easily had; and a ton of coal
will serve for eight tons of bricks. We are
better supplied with straw than if we raised
sugars only; and the apparatus is not expensive.
Only consider, father: the labour of your slaves,
at present, does not average more than fifteen-pence
a day; and brickmakers, in England,
make from five to seven shillings a day. Do let
me try whether, by working by count, we cannot
raise the value of our slave-labour, and save the
expense of importation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, my dear son, we do not want bricks
enough to make it worth while.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our neighbours want them as well as ourselves;
and it may answer well to withdraw a
permanent portion of labour from our coffee-walks
and transfer it to our brick-field. The art
is not difficult, and the climate is most favourable,
so confidently as we may reckon on the absence
of heavy rains for weeks together.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.78'>78</span>“Well; we will see about it, son.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I give you warning, father,” said Alfred,
laughing, “that I shall not be content with one
experiment. If we save by brickmaking, I shall
propose our making the bagging and packages
for our coffee at home, instead of paying so high
as we do for them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, Alfred; what becomes of your boasted
principle of the division of labour?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think as highly as ever of it where labour
is as productive as it ought to be. But where
eight free labourers do as much work as twelve
slaves, it follows that if those twelve slaves were
set free, four of them would be at leisure for
more work. If as much sugar was raised already
as was wanted, those four labourers might make
a great saving by refining and claying the sugars
at home; which business is now done elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the Spanish colonies, where there is a
large proportion of free labourers, I know they
do many things among themselves which British
planters do not, and thus reduce the cost of
cultivation in a way that we should be very glad
to imitate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such imitation is easy enough, surely. We
have only to introduce as large a proportion of
free labour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The wages of free labour are so dreadfully
high,” objected Mr. Bruce.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only in proportion to the scarcity of free
labour, I believe, father. Wherever there is
little of a good thing, it is dear, according to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.79'>79</span>general rule. Slave-labour is not only dear in
itself, but it makes free labour dear also; and
gives an undue advantage to free labourers at
the expense of the other two parties. If we
would but allow natural principles of supply and
free competition to work, the rights of all parties
would be equalized.—But there is Horner hovering
at a distance and looking as if he longed to
come and whip us all round. I must keep him
off, or he will spoil our work. The very sight
of him is enough to paralyse my men; they absolutely
hate him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And well they may,” observed Mr. Bruce.
“I cannot think what makes Mitchelson keep
that man in his service. Even my overseer, who
knows the nature of the business well, calls him
a brute.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred told his father, in a low voice, that
he should think it his duty to get this man discharged
as soon as possible; for he was so
enraged at the adoption of a new plan, and at its
evident success, that it was too probable he would
ill-treat the slaves to the utmost as soon as he
had them again in his power.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He cannot vent his revenge upon me,” said
Alfred, “and will therefore pour it out upon
them; and since I have done the deed, I must
look to the consequences. Having taken these
poor creatures under my care, I must see that
they do not fall back into a worse state than
before. I will not quit Mr. Mitchelson’s side
till I have seen him change his overseer.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.80'>80</span>Mr. Bruce shook his head, and made some
grave remarks upon the imprudence of making
enemies. He did not perceive, and his son did
not remind him, that for his one new enemy he
had secured a posse of grateful friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Mitchelson and his family returned punctually
on the twenty-first day. The dam was, to
their great surprise, finished, the mill fit for use,
the slaves in good plight, the contractor satisfied
and gone home, and all at a less cost than would
have secured the reluctant labour of as many
hands for sixty days;—to say nothing of the
vast advantage of avoiding a suspension of the
usual operations on the estate. Mr. Mitchelson
being, of course, pleased, all was right, except
that Horner snatched every opportunity of oppressing
and thwarting the people under him;
and it was no easy matter to get him dismissed.
He was foolish enough to let fall words in the
hearing of the slaves, which showed that he was
aware he owed his situation to his master’s favour
only, and that he owed Alfred a grudge. The
natural consequence, among a people perfectly
ignorant, and yet subject to human passions, was
that they adored Alfred, and hated Mr. Mitchelson
and his overseer with an intense and almost
equal hatred.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span><br /> <br /> CHRISTIANITY DIFFICULT IN DEMERARA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Mitchelson told his young friend that he
must not think of leaving Paradise at present.
“You have served me in one way,” he said,
“and you now must do it in another. You have
built up my mill-dam, and now you must give
me the pleasure of your society. I shall be little
flattered, if you give me to understand that you
prefer intercourse with my slaves to associating
with me and my family.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred was quite disposed to remain at Paradise
for a few days; and they were made days of
festivity, according to the hospitable customs of
the West Indies. An excursion was planned
for one day, the main object of which was to
inspect an estate, now to be let on lease, for
which Mr. Mitchelson had been authorised by a
friend to negotiate. The ladies of the family
cared little for the estate; but there was some
pretty country a little way beyond which Alfred
had never seen, and which they visited to show
him. A party of pleasure was therefore formed,
and all the elegant accompaniments of such an
arrangement were provided in profusion. The
ladies in carriages, the gentlemen on horseback,
set out in the cool of the morning, saw all they
meant to see, dined luxuriously at the house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.82'>82</span>belonging to the plantation which Mr. Mitchelson
had been left behind to survey, and returned
in good time in the evening. Alfred was rather
surprised at the anxiety of the ladies not to be
delayed beyond a certain hour, and remembered
how apt parties of pleasure in England are to
transgress in this respect: how faithfully they
promise to be home “by ten, at latest,” and how
fidgetty grandfathers, or anxious mothers, or
officious servants, sit at home listening for carriage
wheels, start when the clock strikes eleven,
groan when it comes to twelve, and forgive everything
when the weary, unsociable, young folks
are at last safely housed, and yawn a good night
to each other, leaving everything to be told the
next day. The most unaccountable thing of all
to him, was the extraordinary prudence of the
young people.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, Alfred,” said Mr. Mitchelson, “we
can go so much faster than the carriage this cool
afternoon, that it is a pity you should not see a
fine sea-view there is behind the wood there.
You like a sea-view, I know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O papa!” exclaimed Miss Grace, as she saw
them turning their horses, “what are you going
to do? You do not mean to leave us!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only for half an hour, my dear. We shall
join you where the roads meet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a general cry from the ladies that
it was too late for the party to separate. Mr.
Mitchelson urged that the carriages could take
care of each other, and that he and Alfred could
come to no harm, for he knew the road perfectly,—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.83'>83</span>fine open road, except one bit that led
through a wood;—and the gentlemen trotted off
without more controversy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was true that the road could not be missed.
It was true that, as Mr. Mitchelson protested, the
view was fine enough to have tempted them
twice as far out of their way; but it was not
so true that he was clear about the way
back. He thought he was, or he would not
have ventured; and for a considerable way he
guided his young friend confidently, and congratulated
himself on having suggested so pleasant
a variety in their journey home. But changes
had been made since he last went over the
ground; changes which he was long in perceiving,
and of which he was not fully convinced till
he had become completely bewildered about the
direction in which he was proceeding. They had
entered an extensive wood of which he remembered
nothing: the road branched off, and he
did not know whether to go right or left; and,
what was worse, both roads were found to become
wilder and less marked, till they ended in being
no road at all. There was nothing for it but to
go back; a proceeding which seemed to Alfred
so easy, that he was astonished at the nervous
agitation of his companion, who alternately
checked and urged on his horse, talked fast, or
would say nothing, and at last appeared so
irritable as well as panic-struck, that Alfred
despaired of managing him, and let him take his
own way about what should be done. As might
be expected, he lost the track again. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.84'>84</span>became more involved in shade than ever, and
the short twilight of that climate was darkening
every moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>If Alfred had been alone, or favoured with a
more manly and agreeable companion, he would
have thought it no great hardship to be obliged
to pass the night in the woods of such a country
as this. There could be no richer bower than the
foliage around him; no lamps in a pillared hall
so beautiful as the fire-flies that began already to
flit among the columnar stems which retired in
long perspective on every hand; no perfumes
more delicious than the fragrance of the pimento,
borne through the groves by the whispering nightwind;
no canopy so splendid as the deep blue
heaven where the constellations appeared magnified
as if the powers of the eye had been strengthened,
where the milky-way seemed paved with
planets, and where Venus rose like a little moon,
and in the absence of the greater, casting a
distinguishable shadow from trunk and waving
bough. Alfred’s heart leaped at the idea of
watching, in so favourable a situation, the solemn
march of night, and repairing before the dawn to
the plains whence he might see the first sunbeams
kiss the ocean. He could perceive no
danger, and he felt no want. He could pluck
grass for a bed; he could light a fire, if it
should be necessary; and both had so lately
eaten that there was no fear of being starved
before morning. He turned to his companion,
who had thrown himself from his horse upon the
ground; but Mitchelson’s countenance looked so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.85'>85</span>gloomy in the dim light, that his young friend
hesitated to address him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord have mercy upon us!” groaned Mitchelson.
“What may happen if we cannot get
home?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was not aware there was any danger,” replied
Alfred. “What is our danger? not wild
beasts, nor cold, nor hunger; we can light a
fire——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O! my poor wife. O! my children. Their
friends will leave them, supposing we are coming.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sorry for the fright they will have,”
said Alfred; “but surely they will not think any
great harm can befall us before morning?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O! what may not have happened before
morning? Alfred, I had rather you and I had to
battle with wild beasts than women with slaves.
If the wretches find out my absence——”</p>

<p class='c001'>The cause of all this terror now flashed upon
Alfred: the same cause which made Mitchelson
carry his family with him wherever he went.
He was afraid to leave his household in the
power of his slaves. Yet this was the country
where (so people are told in England) slaves are
contented and happy, and, in every respect,
better off than the free peasantry of the empire!
This was the country whose proprietors dared to
complain of the inefficiency of British law for the
security of property! The present was not the
moment, however, for venting his indignation, or
pointing to the obvious truths which stared him
in the face. Alfred looked on his terrified companion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.86'>86</span>as he sat trembling on the trunk of a
fallen tree, and felt nothing but pity. He could
not triumph while he knew that the unhappy man
was scared with visions of burning cane-fields, of
a murdered wife and insulted children.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not let us give up, if you are really very
anxious to get home,” said Alfred gently. “I
can guide you a little way back, I believe; and
if you will but compose yourself, you may observe
some familiar object before long which will help
us into the right track. We may yet be home
before midnight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was past midnight, however, and the moon
was high in the heaven before they got out of the
wood and found themselves on a road—not the
one they wanted, but one which would lead them
home at length, after a circuit of a few miles.
Mitchelson’s countenance, as seen by the moonlight,
was pale and haggard, and the horses were
so weary that they stumbled continually. Alfred,
too, was sufficiently fatigued to be glad to be relieved
from all difficulty but that of going straight
forward as well as he could, and from all obligation
to converse. He looked at his companion
from time to time, fearing that he might drop
from his horse; for Mitchelson, never strong,
and exposed during the whole day to unusual
fatigue, was ill prepared for an adventure like the
present, and appeared utterly exhausted. Alfred
looked about in vain for any place where they
might stop for a few minutes to refresh themselves.
There were none but clusters of negro-huts
here and there, where all was silent and motionless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.87'>87</span>except that smoke curled up from the
roofs in little white clouds as the silvery light fell
upon them. Mitchelson would not hear of calling
up any one to furnish a calabash of water, or
any more substantial refreshment; and he seemed
particularly uneasy while in the neighbourhood
of these dwellings, starting whenever a bough
dangled in the breeze, and casting a suspicious
glance into the shadows as he urged his horse
forwards. He appeared more in a hurry than
ever, though he actually tottered in his saddle, as
they came to a place which seemed to Alfred as
if he had seen it before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely,” said Alfred, “this is your own
estate. Yes, that hut is Cassius’s. You shall go
no further till you have eaten and drunken, or I
shall have you fainting by the road-side.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So saying, he dismounted, and fastened his
horse to some palings at a little distance from
the hut. Mitchelson tried by word and gesture
to restrain him; but Alfred, who thought his
companion in no condition to take care of himself,
was decided.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fear nothing,” he said, “Cassius and I are
good friends, and it will give him pleasure to be
of service to us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He approached softly, and his footsteps were
not heard, though Cassius was awake, and somewhat
differently engaged from what might have
been expected at such a time of night.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Alfred reached the threshold, he thought
he heard the murmurs of a voice within, and
stepped round to the opening, which served for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.88'>88</span>window, to observe for his guidance what was
passing within. Cassius was alone: it was his
voice that Alfred had heard. His night-fire was
smouldering on the earthen floor, and he was
kneeling beside it, his arms folded, his head
drooped on his breast, except now and then
when he looked up with eyes in which blazed a
much brighter fire than that before him. A
flickering blaze now and then shot up from the
embers, and showed that his face was bathed with
tears or perspiration, and that his strong limbs
shook as if an icy wind was blowing upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred had often wondered, while in England,
what Christianity could be like in a slave country.
Since he arrived in Demerara he had heard
tidings of the Christian teacher who had resided
there for a time, which gave him a sufficiently
accurate notion of the nature of his faith
and of that of the planters; but he was still
curious to know how the Gospel was held by the
slaves. He had now an opportunity of learning,
for Cassius was at prayer. These were snatches
of his prayer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“May he sell no sugar, that no woman may
die of the heat and hard work, and that her baby
may not cry for her. If Christ came to make
men free, let him send a blight that the crop may
be spoiled; for when our master is poor, we shall
be free. O Lord! make our master poor: make
him sit under a tree and see his plantation one
great waste. Let him see that his canes are
dead, and that the wind is coming to blow down
his house and his woods; and then he will say to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.89'>89</span>us, ‘I have no bread for you, and you may go.’
O, God! pity the women who cannot sleep this
night because their sons are to be flogged when
the sun rises. O, pity me, because I have
worked so long, and shall never be free. Do not
say to me, ‘You shall never be free.’ Why
shouldst thou spare Horner who never spares
us? Let him die in his sleep this night, and then
there will be many to sing to thee instead of
wailing all the night. We will sing like the
birds in the morning if thou wilt take away our
fear this night. If Jesus was here, he would
speak kindly to us, and, perhaps, bring a hurricane
for our sakes. O, do not help us less because
he is with thee instead of with us! We
have waited long, O Lord! we have not killed
any one: we have done no harm, because thou
hast commanded us to be patient. If we must
wait, do thou give us patience; for we are very
miserable, and our grief makes us angry. If
we may not be angry, be thou angry with one or
two, that a great many may be happy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>These words caught Alfred’s ear amidst many
which he could not hear. In deep emotion, he
was about to beckon his companion to come and
listen too, when he found he was already at his
elbow.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stand and hear him out,” whispered Alfred.
“You will do him no harm, I am sure. You
will not punish a man for his devotions, be their
character what it may. Let Cassius be master
for once. Let him teach us that which he understands
better than we. He seems to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.90'>90</span>thought more than you or I on what Christ would
say to our authority if He were here. I will go
in when he rises, and hear more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“For God’s sake, do not trust yourself with
him. Let us go. Don’t ask him for water, or
anything else. I will have nothing,—I am going
home this moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I will follow,” said Alfred, knocking at
the door of the hut as soon as he saw that Cassius
had risen and was about to replenish his
fire.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cassius, I have overheard some of your
prayers,” he said, when he had explained to the
astonished slave the cause of his appearance. “I
was glad when you told me that you had been
made a Christian; but your prayer is not that of
a Christian. Surely this is not the way you were
taught to pray?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We were told to pray for the miserable, and
to speak to God as our Father, and tell him all
that we wish. I know none so miserable as
slaves, and therefore I prayed that there might
be an end of their misery. I wish nothing so
much as that I and all slaves may be free, and
so I prayed for it. Is it wrong to pray for this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No. I pray for the same thing, perhaps, as
often as you; <a id='corr90.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='but——'>but——”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_90.27'><ins class='correction'>but——”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you? Do you pray the same prayer as
we do?” cried the slave, falling at Alfred’s feet,
and looking up in his face. “Then let us be
your slaves, and we will all pray together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish to have no slaves, Cassius: I would
rather you should be my servants, if you worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.91'>91</span>for me at all. But we could not pray the same
prayer while you ask for revenge. How dared
you ask that the overseer might die, and that
your master might be poor, and see his estate
laid waste, when you know Jesus prayed for pardon
for his enemies, and commanded us to do
them good when we could?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Was it revenge?” asked Cassius. “I did
not mean it for revenge; but I can never understand
what prayer would best please God. I
would not pray for my master’s sorrow and Horner’s
death if it would do nobody any good, or
even nobody but me; but when I know that
there would be joy in a hundred cottages if there
was death in the overseer’s, may I not pray for
the hundred families? And if I know that the
more barren the land grows, the more the men
will eat, and the women sing, and the children
play, and the sooner I myself shall be free, may
I not pray that the land may be barren? And
as the land grows barren, my master grows poor.
You know the Gospel better than I do. Explain
this to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred did his best to make it clear that, while
blessings were prayed for, the means should be
left to Divine wisdom: but though Cassius acquiesced
and promised, it was plain he did not
see why he should not take for granted the suitableness
of means which appeared to him so
obvious. When Alfred heard what provocation
he had just received, he had only wondered at the
moderation of his petitions, and the patience with
which he bore reproof. Horner had given him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.92'>92</span>notice the preceding evening, that as it appeared
from his exertions at the mill-dam, that he was
of more value than he had always pretended, his
ransom should be doubled. In such a <a id='corr92.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ca e'>case</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_92.4'><ins class='correction'>case</ins></a></span>, a
prayer for such low prices as would lessen his
own value was the most natural that could burst
from the lips of a slave.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred resolved, in his own mind, to obtain
justice for Cassius, but refrained from exciting
hopes which it might be out of his power to
realize. He cheered the slave by accepting food
and drink from him, and by imparting to him
that luxury which it is to be hoped visits this
class of beings more frequently than formerly,—sympathy.
When Cassius came out to hold the
stirrup for Alfred, he looked with a smile at the
moon, and said that there would be time for himself
to sleep before the gong should sound, and
yet more for the gentleman, who need not mind
the gong.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred’s horse had been grazing to such good
purpose during the conversation with Cassius,
that he carried his master home without another
stumble.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.</span><br /> <br /> THE PROUD COVET PAUPERISM IN DEMERARA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It was well that Alfred had held out no expectation
to Cassius that his ransom would be lowered,
or to anybody that the overseer would be dismissed.
Mr. Mitchelson was willing to promise
everything to any person under whose influence
he might be at the time; but as fear had been his
predominant passion ever since the days of the
insurrection which once happened on his estate,
and as Horner had found some means of making
him afraid of him, there seemed little hope that
any counter-influence would be of any avail.
Alfred continued to hover about the plantation,
however, and to give the slaves who had been
exposed to increased hardship by his means, the
protection of his occasional presence, till he was
called away for a time, and obliged to leave his
charge to the tender mercies of their enemy,
while he undertook a yet more pressing responsibility.
The Barbadoes’ estate became his, and
it was necessary that he should proceed to the
spot.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish I could make you think of returning
to live with us, my dear son,” said Mr. Bruce.
“You see we cannot possibly break up our establishment
and come to you. Why cannot you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.94'>94</span>arrange your concerns, and then leave them to
an agent, like other people?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will, I am sure,” added his mother, “if
he has any idea how we dread losing him. Mary,
love, you have more influence than anybody with
your brother; you can persuade him to return
to us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary looked up through her tears, while she
replied that she believed her brother had long
weighed the duty of living on his estate against
other claims; and she hoped he would do what
he thought right, and then it was certain he would
come back if he could.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred declared that it was a great grief to
him to leave his family so soon, and that he
should return as speedily and as often as possible
to visit them; but that he could not promise to
reside permanently anywhere but on his own
estate.</p>

<p class='c001'>His father observed that there were plenty of
agents to be had, and that he was sorry some
friends of his in England had prejudiced his son
against management by agents.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred observed that, believing, as he did, that
the non-residence of proprietors was the curse of
the West Indies, he could not conscientiously
add his weight to the burden. Neither was he
at all sure that he could afford the heavy expenses
of agency, or that any of the plans
for which he had been expressly educated could
be fairly tried without his superintendence.
Whatever might be the honesty and obedience
of an agent, and however strong his own confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.95'>95</span>in one recommended by his father, it was
impossible that any man should discern his views
so clearly or take so warm an interest in their
issue, as himself. It appeared to him that a critical
period in the state of his slave population
had arrived, and he could not forgive himself if
he gave the management into other hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am glad you are aware,” said his father,
“that Barbadoes is little like Demerara. What
you have seen here affords no rule for what you
are to do there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“One kind of rule, perhaps,” said Alfred,
smiling; “the rule of contrary. Here soils are
fertile, there barren; here the slave population
decreases as rapidly as it increases there; here
slaves are very valuable, there they are worth
little; here they are manumitted at the average
of 27, there of 125 in a year, the impediment of
a heavy tax remaining in each.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you had rather have an estate in Barbadoes
than here,” said Mary, “whatever your
profits may be?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Much rather. Slavery, like other institutions,
is only enforced where it is worth enforcing;
and since it is found less worth enforcing
in Barbadoes than elsewhere, I shall meet with
the less opposition to measures which I should
have adopted wherever my estate had happened
to lie. I do not despair of inducing some of my
neighbours to make free labourers of their blacks,
if, as I expect, they already find that they are of
little value as slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The reason why they are so little <a id='corr95.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='valuable,’'>valuable,”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_95.33'><ins class='correction'>valuable,”</ins></a></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.96'>96</span>said Mr. Bruce, “is that there is less sugar
grown in Barbadoes than in any of the colonies
which grow sugar at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True,” said Alfred. “The soil of Barbadoes
produces less sugar; the planters therefore profit
less by the bounty on sugars: they are less
tempted to overwork their slaves, and to reduce
their provision-grounds to the narrowest limits
prescribed by law; the slaves therefore increase
beyond the proportion wanted for the land, and
of course obtain their freedom easily. The exact
reverse is the case here. Here the most sugar
is grown, the largest share of the bounty taken,
the slaves most overworked and underfed, their
numbers decreasing, their value increasing, and
their freedom the most difficult to achieve.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary looked up from her work, observing that
the bounty was then the great obstacle to emancipation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The one obstacle,” replied her brother,
“without which no other could stand for an
hour. Louisa, my dear, bring me a map of the
world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of the world!” exclaimed the little girl; “I
could show you the way to Barbadoes with a
much smaller map than that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You shall teach me the way to Barbadoes
afterwards; I want the larger map first. Look
here, Mary. See here what the whole world owes
to British legislation on the sugar trade! Let
us first find out to what extent sugar might be
grown if we had to consider climate only.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have always wondered,” said Mary, “why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.97'>97</span>there was no sugar grown in Africa, or in any
part of South America but the little angle we inhabit.
So it might be anywhere within that line.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Anywhere (as far as climate is concerned)
within thirty degrees of the equator. There
are duties which prohibit the English from purchasing
sugar from China, New Holland, the Indian
Archipelago, Arabia, Mexico, and all South
America, but our little corner here; and from
Africa none is to be had either. The slave-trade
has destroyed all hope of that, independently of
all restrictions. The slave-trade has been like
a plague in Africa.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, but you have passed over Hindostan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The trade is not absolutely prohibited there;
but it is restricted and limited by high duties.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What remains then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only our corner of the world, and a tiny
territory it is, to be protected at the expense of
such vast tracts—only the West India Islands,
and a slip of the continent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But surely it is a hardship on the inhabitants
of these other countries, to be prevented supplying
the British with sugars?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a hardship to all parties in turn—to
the British, that the price is artificially raised,
and the quantity limited; to the inhabitants of
these vast tracts, that they are kept out of the
market; to the West India planters; but most
of all, to the slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To the planters? Why, I thought it was
for their sakes that the monopoly was ordered!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So it is; but they suffer far more than they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.98'>98</span>gain by it. The cultivation of sugar is at present
a forced cultivation, attended with expense and
hazard, and only to be maintained by a monopoly
price, both high and permanent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look at Mitchelson’s plantation, and see
whether its aspect is that of a thriving property!
A miserable hoe, used by men and women with
the whip at their backs, the only instrument used
in turning up the soil, while there are such
things in the world as drill ploughs and cattle!
A soil exhausted more and more every year!
A population decreasing every year, in a land
and climate most favourable to increase! Are
these signs of prosperity? Yet all these are the
consequence of a monopoly which tempts to the
production of sugar at all hazards, and at every
cost.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see how all these evils would disappear,
brother, if the trade were free; but could the
proprietors stand the shock? Could they go
through the <a id='corr98.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='transition?’'>transition?”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_98.21'><ins class='correction'>transition?”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes; if they chose to set about it properly,
living on their own estates, and making use of
modern improvements in the management of
the land. If the soil were improved to the extent
it might be, the West Indies might compete
with any country in the world. The planter
would estimate his property by the condition of
his land, and not by the number of his slaves.
He would command a certain average return
from the effective labour he would then employ,
instead of the capricious and fluctuating profits
he now derives from a species of labour which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.99'>99</span>is as impolitic as guilty to employ; and, as the
demand for sugar would continually increase,
after the effects of free competition had once been
felt, there would be no fear of a decline of trade.
A soil and climate like this are sufficient warrants
that the West Indies may trade in sugar
to the end of the world, if a fair chance is given
by an open trade.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then if economy became necessary, there
would be no slaves; for it is pretty clear that
slave labour is dear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Slavery can only exist where men are scarce
in proportion to land; and as the population
would by this time have increased, and be increasing,
slavery would have died out. At
present, land is abundant, fertile, and cheap in
Demerara, and labour decreases every year; so
that slaves are valuable, and their prospect of
emancipation but distant. But in my estate, as
I have told you, the land is by far less fertile,
labour more abundant, and slavery wearing out.
My exertions will be directed towards improving
my land, and increasing the supply of labour;
by which I shall gain the double advantage of
procuring labour cheap, and hastening the work
of emancipation. I hope no new monopoly will
be proposed, which should tempt me to change
my plan, and aid and abet slavery.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can trust you,” said Mary, smiling. “You
would not yield to the temptation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I trust not, sister: but I will not answer for
the effect of living long in a slave country. The
very sight of slavery is corrupting, to say nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.100'>100</span>of the evil of holding property under the system.
But I feel resolute enough at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Remember, my dear son,” said Mr. Bruce,
“that you may find, as many find, that principles
which seem very clear when only reasoned
on, turn out very differently when applied to
practice. There is your principle that you argue
upon, as if it was a settled matter, that high
prices stimulate supply——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, father, what of it? Is it not true,
when things take their natural course?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I only know that it is not true here, if what
you have been saying is true. The high prices
you complain of lessen instead of increasing the
supply of labour. Did not you say so?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did; and I think the fact only shows that
labour is not supplied in its natural course. You
see the principle operates naturally upon the
masters. It stimulates <em>them</em> to the production
of sugar to such a degree as to ruin their soils;
and if the supply of labour fails in proportion to
the rise of prices, it proves,—not that a principle
is false, which holds good everywhere else,—but
that the peculiar kind of labour used here is not
rightly held or naturally recompensed. This is
only another of the many reversals of all allowed
rules, which are so striking to those who watch
West Indian policy from a distance. We might
make another picture out of it for our new Topsy
Turvy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would make two pictures,” said Mary.
“John Bull comes with a high price in his hand
to buy sugar of a free labourer, who works harder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.101'>101</span>and harder, grows rich, and employs a tribe of
labourers under him. John Bull brings the same
price to a slave. He pines and will not work:
the price is lessened; he brightens, works, eats,
and grows fat. It dwindles to nothing, and he
leaps for joy, snaps his fingers in his master’s
face, and hugs John Bull with might and main.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred laughed while he admitted this to be
a true picture. In answer to an objection from
his father, that slaves were not fit to employ and
enjoy freedom, he mentioned the remarkable fact
that scarcely any free blacks receive parish relief
in comparison with whites, though their civil and
political disabilities are such as to impose great
hardships upon them. If, in an average of six
years, including the whole of our West Indian
colonies, it be found, (and it has been proved,)
that out of a free black and coloured population
of 88,000, only one in 387 has received even
occasional parish relief, while, out of a white
population of 63,400, one in 38 has been so
relieved, it is pretty plain that the manumitted
slaves are not too vicious or idle to take care of
themselves; and there is an end to the common
objection to manumission, that the freed slaves
must increase the burden of pauperism.</p>

<p class='c001'>It had frequently occurred to Alfred, that forebodings
of pauperism came with a very ill grace
from a body who subsist on the most expensive
pauper establishment ever invented. The West
India monopoly is a most burdensome poor-rate,
levied by compulsion, and bestowed on those
who ought to maintain themselves. It operates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.102'>102</span>as poor-rates always do, in producing discontents
among those who pay, and indolence, recklessness,
waste, and profligacy, among those who
receive it, together with incessant and greedy
demands for further assistance. The main difference
is, that the West India paupers might
and would flourish, if the mother country could
be prevailed upon to withhold the alms so clamorously
craved; which is more, alas! than can
be said in the case of parish paupers. Alfred
thought that this consideration would for ever
strengthen him to stem the current of public
opinion, which, however narrow and foul, runs
so strongly in the West Indies as to require the
force of a strong mind to keep its place in it.
Happen what might, he could never submit to
be a pauper.</p>

<p class='c001'>He hoped, however, that the days of strong
temptation were over,—that slavery was a perishing
system,—a system that must perish ere long
under any kind of management. High prices,
rich lands, and scarcity of people, in conjunction,
he argued, are the only supports of slavery.</p>

<p class='c001'>High prices exhaust lands; so there is a
prospect of an end of slavery this way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moderate prices cause an increase of people;
so there is the same prospect this way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Low prices only effect the same end more
rapidly.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, with a clear conviction that slavery must,
at all events, come to an end, Alfred set sail for
Barbadoes. The chief object of his going was
to learn what he could do to hasten the wished-for
day.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.</span><br /> <br /> CALAMITY WELCOME IN DEMERARA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>There was every promise of a fine crop this
season in Mr. Bruce’s plantation. The coffee-walks
had been refreshed by frequent showers,
and were screened from the chill north winds;
and the fruit looked so well that, as the owner
surveyed his groves the day before the gathering
began, he flattered himself with the hopes of a
crop so much above the average as might clear
off some of the debts which began to press
heavily upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>His daughters remained at his side during the
whole of this cheerful season; for Mary had but
a faint remembrance, which she wished to revive,
of its customs and festivities. The time of crop
is less remarkable and less joyous in a coffee
than a sugar plantation; but there is much in
both to engage the eye and interest the heart.
The sugar crop had been got in three months
before, and Mary had then visited the Mitchelsons,
and seen how marvellously the appearance
of the working population, both man and beast,
had improved in a very short time. Horses,
oxen, mules, and even pigs, had fattened upon
the green tops of the cane and upon the scum
from the boiling-house; while the meagre and
sickly among the slaves recovered their looks
rapidly while they had free access to the nourishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.104'>104</span>juice which oozed from the mill. The
abundance of food more than made up for the
increase of labour; and the slaves, while more
hardly worked than ever, seemed to mind it less,
and to wear a look of cheerfulness sufficiently
rare at other seasons.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was less apparent enjoyment to all parties
at the time of gathering in the coffee, though
it was a sight not to be missed by a stranger.
The slaves could not grow fat upon the fruit of
the coffee-tree as upon the juice of the cane;
but as there was an extra allowance of food in
consideration of the extra labour, the slaves went
through it with some degree of willingness. The
weather was oppressively hot, too; but Mary
found it as tolerable in the shade of the walks
as in the house. She sat there for hours, under
a large umbrella, watching the slaves, as each
slowly filled the canvass-bag hung round his
neck, and kept open by a hoop. She followed
them with her eyes when they sauntered from
the trees to the baskets to empty their pouches,
and then back again to the trees; and listened
to the rebukes of the overseer when he found
unripe fruit among the ripe.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure,” said she to her father one day,
“I should come in for many a scolding if I had
to pick coffee to-day. If the heat makes us faint
as we lie in the shade, what must it be to those
who stand in the sun from morning till night!
I could not lift a hand, or see the difference
between one berry and another.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.105'>105</span>“Blacks bear the heat better than we do,”
observed Mr. Bruce. “However, it is really
dreadfully sultry to-day. I have seldom felt it
so much myself, and I believe the slaves will be
as glad as we when night comes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The little puffs of air that leave a dead
calm,” said Mary, “only provoke one to remember
the steady breeze we did not know how
to value when we had it. I should not care for
a thunderstorm if it would but bring coolness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Would not you? You little know what
thunderstorms are here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You forget how many we had in the spring.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Those were no more like what we shall have
soon, than a June night-breeze in England is like
a January frost-wind. You may soon know, however,
what a Demerara thunderstorm is like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary looked about her as her father pointed,
and saw that the face of nature was indeed
changed. She had mentioned a thunderstorm
because she had heard the overseer predict the
approach of one.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a mass of clouds towering in a distant
quarter of the heavens, not like a pile of
snowy peaks, but now rent apart and now tumbled
together, and bathed in a dull, red light. The
sun, too, looked large and red, while distant objects
wore a bluish cast, and looked larger and
nearer than usual. There was a dead calm. The
pigeon had ceased her cooing: no parrots were
showing off their gaudy plumage in the sunlight,
and not even the hum of the enamelled beetle
was heard.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.106'>106</span>“What is the moon’s age?” asked Mr. Bruce
of the overseer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She is full to-night, sir, and a stormy night
it will be I fear.” He held up his finger and
listened.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hark!” said Mary, “there is the thunder
already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not thunder, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is the sea,” said Louisa. “I never heard
it here but once before; but I am sure it is the
same sound.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The sea at this distance!” cried Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her father shook his head, muttering, “God
help all who are in harbour, and give them a
breeze to carry them out far enough! The
shore will be strewed with wrecks by the morning.
Come, my dears, let us go home before
yonder clouds climb higher.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The whites have not yet become as weather-wise,
between the tropics, as the negroes; and
both fall short of the foresight which might be
attained, and which was actually possessed by
the original inhabitants of these countries. A
negro cannot, like them, predict a storm twelve
days beforehand; but he is generally aware of
its approach some hours sooner than his master.
It depends upon the terms he happens to be on
with the whites, whether or not he gives them
the advantage of his observations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Old Mark sent his daughter Becky to Mr. Bruce’s
house to deliver his opinion on the subject;
but all were prepared. No such friendly
warning was given to the Mitchelsons, who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.107'>107</span>overcome with the heat, were, from the eldest to
the youngest, lying on couches, too languid to
lift up their heads or think of what might be
passing out of doors. Cassius, meanwhile, was
leaning over the gate of his provision-ground
watching the moon as she rose, crimson as
blood, behind his little plantain grove. Every
star looked crimson too, and had its halo like the
moon. It was as if a bloody steam had gone up
from the earth. Not a breath of air could yet
be felt; yet here and there a cedar, taller than
the rest, stooped and shivered; and the clouds,
now rushing, now poised motionless, indicated a
capricious commotion in the upper air. Cassius
was watching with much interest these signs of
an approaching tempest, when he felt himself
pulled by the jacket.</p>

<p class='c001'>“May I stay with you?” asked poor Hester.
“My master and mistress dare not keep at home
because our roof is almost off already, and they
think the wind will carry it quite away to-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where are they gone?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To find somebody to take them in; but they
say there will be no room for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stay with me then; but nobody will be safe
under a roof to-night, I think.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where shall we stay then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here, unless God calls us away. Many may
be called before morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The little girl stood trembling, afraid of she
scarcely knew what, till a tremendous clap of
thunder burst near, and then she clung to Cassius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.108'>108</span>and hid her face. In a few moments the
gong was heard, sounding in the hurried irregular
manner which betokens an alarm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aha!” cried Cassius. “The white man’s
house shakes and he is afraid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What does he call us for?” said the terrified
child. “We can do him no good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; but his house is stronger than ours;
and if his shakes, ours may tumble down, and
then he would lose his slaves and their houses
too. So let us go into the field where we are
called, and then we shall see how pale white
men can look.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All the way as they went, Hester held one
hand before her eyes, for the lightning flashes
came thick and fast. Still there was neither
wind nor rain; but the roar of the distant sea
rose louder in the intervals of the thunder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius suddenly stopt short, and pulled the
little girl’s hand from before her face, crying,
“Look, look, there is a sight!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hester shrieked when she saw a whole field of
sugar-canes whirled in the air. Before they had
time to fall, the loftiest trees of the forest were
carried up in like manner. The mill disappeared,
a hundred huts were levelled; there was a stunning
roar, a rumbling beneath, a rushing above.
The hurricane was upon them in all its fury.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius clasped the child round the waist, and
carried rather than led her at his utmost speed
beyond the verge of the groves, lest they also
should be borne down and crush all beneath
them. When he had arrived with his charge in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.109'>109</span>the field whither the gong had summoned him,
slaves were arriving from all parts of the plantation
to seek safety in an open place. Their
black forms flitting in the mixed light,—now in
the glare of the lightning, and now in the rapid
gleams which the full moon cast as the clouds
were swept away for a moment, might have
seemed to a stranger like imps of the storm,
collecting to give tidings of its ravages. Like
such imps they spoke and acted.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The mill is down!” cried one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No crop next year, for the canes are blown
away!” shouted another.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The hills are bare as a rock,—no coffee, no
spice, no cotton! Hurra!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But our huts are gone: our plantation-grounds
are buried,” cried the wailing voice of
a woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hurra! for the white man’s are gone too!”
answered many mingled tones. Just then a
burst of moonlight showed to each the exulting
countenances of the rest, and there went up a
shout louder than the thunder,—“Hurra
hurra! how ugly is the land!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The sound was hushed, and the warring lights
were quenched for a time by the deluge which
poured down from the clouds. The slaves
crouched together in the middle of the field,
supporting one another as well as they could
against the fury of the gusts which still blew,
and of the tropical rains. An inquiry now went
round,—where was Horner? It was his duty to
be in the field as soon as the gong had sounded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.110'>110</span>but no one had seen him. There was a stern
hope in every heart that his roof had fallen in
and buried him and his whip together. It was
not so, however.</p>

<p class='c001'>After a while, the roaring of water was heard
very near, and some of the blacks separated from
the rest to see in what direction the irregular
torrents which usually attend a hurricane were
taking their course. There was a strip of low
ground between the sloping field where the negroes
were collected and the opposite hill, and
through the middle of this ground a river rushed
along where a river had never been seen before.
A tree was still standing here and there in the
midst of the foaming waters, and what had, a
few minutes ago, been a hillock with a few shrubs
growing out of it, was now an island. The
negroes thought they heard a shout from this
island, and then supposed it must be fancy; but
when the cloudy rack was swept away and allowed
the moon to look down for a moment, they saw
that some one was certainly there, clinging to
the shrubs, and in imminent peril of being carried
away if the stream should continue to rise.
It was Horner, who was making his way to the
field when the waters overtook him in the low
ground, and drove him to the hillock to seek a
safety which was likely to be short enough. The
waters rose every moment: and though the distance
was not above thirty feet from the hillock
to the sloping bank on which the negroes had
now ranged themselves to watch his fate, the
waves dashed through in so furious a current
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.111'>111</span>that he did not dare to commit himself to them.
He called, he shouted, he screamed for help, his
agony growing more intense, as inch after inch,
foot after foot, of his little shore disappeared.
The negroes answered his shouts very punctually;
but whether the impatience of peril prompted
the thought, or an evil conscience, or whether it
were really so, the shouts seemed to him to
have more of triumph than sympathy in them;
and cruel as would have been his situation had
all the world been looking on with a desire to
help, it was dreadfully aggravated by the belief
that the wretches whom he had so utterly despised
were watching his struggles, and standing with
folded arms to see how he would help himself
when there was none to help him. He turned
and looked to the other shore; but it was far
too distant to be reached. If he was to be saved,
it must be by crossing the narrower gulley; and,
at last, a means of doing so seemed to offer.
Several trees had been carried past by the current;
but they were all borne on headlong, and he had
no means of arresting their course: but one
came at length, a trunk of the largest growth,
and therefore making its way more slowly than
the rest. It tilted from time to time against the
bank, and when it reached the island, fairly stuck
at the very point where the stream was narrowest.
With intense gratitude,—gratitude which two
hours before he would have denied could ever be
felt towards slaves,—Horner saw the negroes
cluster about the root of the tree to hold it firm
in its position. Its branchy head seemed to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.112'>112</span>to be secure, and the only question now was,
whether he could keep his hold on this bridge,
while the torrent rose over it, as if in fury at
having its course delayed. He could but try, for
it was his only chance. The beginning of his
adventure would be the most perilous, on account
of the boughs over and through which he must
make his way. Slowly, fearfully, but firmly he
accomplished this, and the next glimpse of moonlight
showed him astride on the bare trunk, clinging
with knees and arms, and creeping forward
as he battled with the spray. The slaves were no
less intent. Not a word was spoken, not one let
go, and even the women would have a hold. A
black cloud hid the moon just when Horner
seemed within reach of the bank; and what happened
in that dark moment,—whether it was the
force of the stream, or the strength of the temptation,—no
lips were ever known to utter; but
the event was that the massy trunk heaved once
over, the unhappy wretch lost his grasp, and was
carried down at the instant he thought himself
secure. Horrid yells once more arose, from the
perishing man, and from the blacks now dispersed
along the bank to see the last of him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is not gone yet,” was the cry of one;
“he climbed yon tree as if he had been a water
rat.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There let him sit if the wind will let him,”
cried another. “That he should have been
carried straight to a tree after all!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stand fast! here comes the gale again!”
shouted a third.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.113'>113</span>The gale came. The tree in which Horner
had found refuge bowed, cracked,—but before it
fell, the wretch was blown from it like a flake
of foam, and swallowed up finally in the surge
beneath. This was clearly seen by a passing
gleam.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hurra! hurra!” was the cry once more.
“God sent the wind. It was God that murdered
him, not we.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When the planters were sufficiently recovered
to exchange letters of condolence, Mr. Mitchelson
wrote thus to Mr. Bruce. “You have
probably heard that my overseer, poor Horner,
was lost from the waters being out when he was
making his way to the field where his duty called
him. We all lament him much; but your son
will be glad to hear (pray tell him when you
write) that my slaves are conducting themselves
as well as if still under the charge of him we
have lost. I am persuaded they would have
risked their own lives to save his, if it had been
possible. But, as they say, it was God’s will
that he should perish!”</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter X.</span> <br /> <br /> PROTECTION IS OPPRESSION IN DEMERARA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The external devastation which attends a hurricane
is by no means the only evil it brings.
Where there is any difficulty in the management
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.114'>114</span>of affairs, public or private, it is sure to be increased
or made insurmountable by any general
excuse for aggression or rebellion. Many an
insurrection has taken place during or immediately
after a hurricane. Many a half-ruined
planter has found his embarrassments brought to
a crisis by the crowd of demands which are
hastened instead of deferred by disaster. This
was now Mr. Bruce’s case.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as this gentleman had seen the destruction
of all the hopes he had built on his
coffee-crop, he began to fear a seizure of his
slaves by his creditors. He assembled them
within an inclosure as fast as possible, and erected
his fences, and had them guarded with the utmost
care, that he might at all events exempt his
human property from a legal seizure. But his
precautions were vain. Some gap was found, or
pretended to be found, through which the officers
entered in the night, and levied slaves for the
benefit of his creditors. This was sad news for
the breakfast-table; and as Mr. Bruce was really
a kind-hearted man, it added to his concern that,
in the confusion of the seizure and in the darkness
of midnight, the slaves had been carried off
without the usual care being taken not to separate
families: for some regard is paid to this
consideration in the absence of temptation to
overlook it. Old Mark’s household, among others,
had been divided. Becky was this morning
sitting in grief beside her aged father, while
Willy and Nell (whose lover had been left behind)
were marching, in sullen despair, with drivers at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.115'>115</span>their backs, they knew not whither, to become
the property of they knew not whom.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would have been hard to say among what
class of persons the deepest distress prevailed in
consequence of this hurricane, which the revengeful
impulses of the blacks had made them
for a moment hail as a friend. The slaves who
were levied for their master’s debts mourned as
if they were carried anew into a strange land:
their friends at home wept for them more bitterly
than if they had been dead; for they were gone
to renew their mortal sorrows instead of finding
peace and freedom in the better land beyond the
grave. Cassius’s heart was burning within him
because the prospect of freedom, of late so hopeful
though not very near, was now removed for ever,
or to so great a distance as to leave him in
despair. He was to be sold; and it would be
long before the value of slaves, now considerably
raised by the event which had happened, would
be so lowered as to admit of a hope of obtaining
ransom. Cassius’s earnings being found to be
greater than was expected, his price was considerably
raised, and he was placed first in the lot
of marketable slaves on Mitchelson’s estate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The master, meanwhile, was lamenting the
loss of his factotum, Horner, and indolently
dreading the difficulties of making new arrangements,
and doing some things himself which he
had been accustomed to leave to his overseer.
But his distress was nothing compared with his
friend, Mr. Bruce’s. In perpetual fear of arrest,
he dared not go out of doors to see what had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.116'>116</span>happened and what must be done. He delayed
from day to day looking into his affairs, suspecting
that he should find total ruin at the
bottom. He resisted, partly through shame, and
partly through tenderness for Alfred, every entreaty
to send for his son and to bring his affairs
to a certain issue. He wrote, “do not think of
coming” in every letter; but it chanced one day
that Mary found an opportunity of putting in a
postscript to this effect: “Notwithstanding what
my father says about your remaining where you
are, I think, and so does my mother, that it
would do him a world of good to see you. He
grows more anxious every day, and there is
nobody here who can help to comfort him as
you could.” Upon this hint Alfred appeared.
He little thought how the other suffering parties
we have mentioned had cast a longing look
towards him, as the friend most likely to aid
them, or to sorrow with them if he could not
assist.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our young master would have Willy and
Nell brought back if he was here,” observed
Becky to her father.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Alfred would not let my ransom be
raised, or may be he would buy me himself, now
he has an estate,” sighed Cassius.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would persuade Alfred to train my new
overseer, and advise me what to do, if I could
get at him,” observed Mitchelson. “He did
wonders at that mill-dam, and I am sure he would
do no less now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So when Alfred appeared, a gleam of pleasure
passed over many a heavy countenance.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.117'>117</span>“My dear son!” exclaimed Mr. Bruce. “We
are always glad to see you. Who is not? But
you have come at the very best moment. There
is to be a meeting of planters to-morrow. You
cannot think how I dread appearing; and now
you will go instead of me. It is necessary
that this estate should be represented; and you
may truly say that I am too ill to appear in person.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred was ready to be useful in any way; but
urged the necessity of his being fully informed
respecting his father’s affairs before he could act
as his proxy. He begged that this day might
be devoted to an inspection of the accounts.
Mr. Bruce groaned; but on this point his son
was firm. The two gentlemen and the agent
whom Mr. Bruce’s indolence had induced him to
employ, were closeted for the rest of the day
with their books and papers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Bruce lay sighing and weeping the whole
day, offering a passive resistance to all the
comfort her daughter endeavoured to bestow.
In the evening, Mary left her for a few minutes,
to seek the refreshment of the cool air of the
garden. She remained within sight of the room
where the inquiry was going forward on which
so much depended; looking up to the windows
every moment as if she could learn anything by
that means of the probable fate of the family.
At last she saw somebody moving within: it
was Alfred who came to the window, saw her,
made a sign to her to remain where she was, and
presently was drawing her arm within his own,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.118'>118</span>and leading her where they could not be overheard.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred explained that his father was indeed
deep in debt, but that his incumbrances might be
cleared off by good management, as they had
only been brought on by indolence and waste.
If his father would dismiss his agent, and conduct
his affairs himself; if he would introduce a better
division of labour, and a greater economy of the
resources of the estate, all might be redeemed
within a few years.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Can I do nothing to assist?” Mary anxiously
inquired. “I know I can introduce economy
into our household arrangements, for my mother
leaves them more and more to me: but can I
help my father as well?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You may, by taking an interest in what
ought to be his business. Go with him sometimes
when he superintends in the field, and show him
that you understand accounts, and keep an eye
upon the books. You know as much of accounts
as I do, and let him see that he may trust you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I may thank Mrs. H—— for teaching me
this part of a woman’s business,” said Mary.
“She managed the fortunes of her five children
from the day of her husband’s death till their
majority, and I am thankful that she taught me
what may now be so useful. I may learn the
values of coffee in time; and in the meanwhile
I will make use of what I know of that of pounds,
shillings, and pence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is no mean knowledge, sister, since, in
your case, the happiness of some hundreds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.119'>119</span>human beings is affected by it. The fate of our
slaves depends on the state of my father’s affairs.
I commend their comfort to you. Soften their
hardships much as your influence allows, and
then my father will soon find that their happiness
and his prosperity go together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, Alfred! have I any power,—any responsibility
of this kind? It makes me tremble
to think of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If ladies have been frequently cited to answer
the complaints of slaves, (which you know
to be the case,) it is clear that they have influence
over the fate of these unhappy dependants.
If the wife of a planter has been imprisoned
for torturing a slave, why should not the daughter
of a planter use her influence to save her
father’s slaves from punishment, or, better still,
keep them from deserving it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have been with old Mark to-day,” said
Mary, “and I have been trying all means I
could think of to get Becky to complain to
my father, instead of the Protector, about Sunday
labour: but she is so fierce, I can make
nothing of her. She never said a word about
it while she had her brother with her, but she
declares she must make her complaints for herself
now he is gone. I dread the exposure, and
she might get redress from my father, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred had heard with grief that Willy and
Nell were among the levied slaves. What his
sister now said determined him to seek out old
Mark and his daughter without delay; and the
brother and sister were soon at the door of the
hut.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.120'>120</span>Mark was sitting in the only chair the hut
contained, talking as if to people round him,
though he was alone. Alfred immediately saw
that the little light of intellect which old age had
left was quenched. The cause of this was evident
from his taking every man who came near him
for Willy, and every woman for Nell.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How much did you sell the pig for?” he
asked Alfred. “He brought a good price, for
your clothes are as fine as a white’s.—But,”
suddenly recollecting himself, “how did you get
back? O, you will be flogged for a runaway.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is Mr. Alfred. You remember your
young master, Mr. Alfred?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! Mr. Alfred is come to your wedding,
Nell. Why, my wife did not look as pretty as
you on her wedding-day. And who married
you, and why did not you let me go to your
wedding? Becky said you could not be married
because they had carried you away, but now you
are back again, I will sing you a song I made
for you and Harry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Presently the old man broke off singing in a
great passion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Willy, you are a dog to bring me no water
when I am so thirsty;” and he shook a stick at
his young master.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred humoured him and took down a calabash,
and was filling it with water when Becky
came home.</p>

<p class='c001'>“See, Becky, what it is to be married!” cried
the old man. “When will you be as fine as
Nelly?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.121'>121</span>Becky made no answer, but snatched the calabash
from Alfred’s hand, and served her father
herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You would not believe that I could save you
from Sunday labour, Becky,” said Mary. “Here
is my brother: you had better make your complaint
to him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Becky was so far from being reserved, as she
had been in the morning, about this complaint,
that she poured out her grievances as fast as she
could speak, and far faster than Alfred could
understand her. The fact was, she had applied
to the Protector of slaves, and he had dismissed
her complaint as frivolous and vexatious, because
she owned that she had frequently gone through
an equal portion of Sunday labour without complaint.
She was now furious against all parties,
and would scarcely hold her tongue long enough
to hear Alfred say that he thought her’s a hard
case, and only blamed her for not having complained
long before.</p>

<p class='c001'>It appeared that the overseer was in the habit
of appointing a heavier task on Saturdays than
other days, and of compelling the completion of
it on the Sunday. It was evident that, if he chose
to appoint a double task on the Saturday, the
negroes might be deprived altogether of the
benefit of the Sunday: and the young people
thought that one such attempt to evade the law
on the part of the overseer was enough to warrant
his immediate dismissal, if it could be proved
against him; and that the Protector of slaves
could be little fit for his office, if he made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.122'>122</span>frequent repetition of a grievance the reason for
not redressing it. Becky smiled incredulously
when Alfred promised that he would come, next
Sunday morning, and see whether she was at
work or at leisure; and if the former, on what
pretence.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had some hope of being able by that time
to make some arrangement for the return of the
brother and sister, as he was to meet their present
owner at the assembly of planters on the
Wednesday; but the event disappointed him.
Everything went wrong at the meeting. He
dissented entirely from the prayer of the petition
to government which had been agreed on; he
disapproved of the tone of indignant complaint
assumed by the planters, and failed in his endeavour
to convince some of them that the remedy
for their grievances rested with themselves.
He had laid his accounts for being treated as a
visionary, and for his own plans being laughed
at as absurd; but he was not prepared for being
put down because his father’s affairs were known
to be in a bad state; or for the insulting mirth
with which all humane suggestions were received,
even while the name of Providence was on every
tongue. But nothing disgusted him so much as
the apathy with which his father’s principal creditor
turned from the offer of a negociation about
the restoration of Willy and Nell. There seemed
no hope of effecting their return; and the only
prospect he could hold out to Becky was that of
joining them whenever the death of her father
should release her from her attendance upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.123'>123</span>him; and this could be done only by sacrificing
her lover, as her sister had been compelled to
do by force.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter XI.</span> <br /> <br /> BEASTS HUNT MEN IN DEMERARA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The absent brother and sister were less willing
to relinquish the hope of return. Upon this hope
they had lived from the moment of their departure:
they saw it in each other’s eyes, while their
captivity was too new to allow them an opportunity
of speaking of it; and they kept it alive
by sympathy when some relaxation of discipline
allowed them to exchange a whisper from time
to time. They planned to escape in the night,
to take refuge in the woods, and subsist there as
well as they could till the search should be over,
and they could find their way back to Mr. Bruce’s
estate, and throw themselves at their master’s
feet to petition for such an exchange of slaves as
would allow them to remain in their old habitation.
They had no thought of evading slavery
altogether. They had no means of leaving the
coast, or of obtaining their freedom within it.
The utmost they hoped was to spend a life of
slavery under a lenient master, and among those
they had long known, and could love: a wish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.124'>124</span>not so very immoderate or presumptuous, it may
be thought, as to merit very severe chastisement.
Yet they knew that no punishment would be
thought too heavy, if they should be detected in
cherishing this hope.</p>

<p class='c001'>One afternoon, they and their black brethren
on the estate were left unguarded, owing to the
sudden illness of the driver, who fell down in the
field and was carried home in fits. A glance
instantly passed from Willy to Nell, and joy was
in their hearts that an opportunity of escape
should occur so much sooner than they had expected.
There was no roll-call that night. If
there had been, the brother and sister would
have been called in vain, for they were already
on their perilous way to the woods. Nobody
missed them: they met nobody as they proceeded
in the shade till sunset, and over the plain
in the twilight, till they reached the forest. They
did not know their way any further than they
had been able to study it by observing the stars.
They were to travel northward when the time
should come for them to proceed to Mr. Bruce’s;
but their immediate object was to escape pursuit:
and as pursuit would most probably be
directed where it would be guessed they wished
to go, they turned due west for the present, as
soon as they could make out the points of the
compass by the lights overhead. They pushed
on at their utmost speed, disregarding cold, hunger,
and the difficulties of the way. They hastily
plucked wild fruit when it hung within reach,
now creeping through thick underwood, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.125'>125</span>helping one another over fragments of rock,
and never stopped till day began to dawn.
Then Nell cast herself down on the ground,
and besought her brother to let her rest. He
now observed for the first time that one of
her feet was covered with blood, and frightfully
swollen. A large thorn had pierced it some
hours before, and as she had in her hurry let it
remain, it was buried too deep to be easily got
out, and she was so lame as to be unable to go
farther.</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy looked round anxiously, and walked
from side to side to gaze abroad and see whether
this spot was easily accessible from any quarter.
He came back presently with a more cheerful
countenance, saying,</p>

<p class='c001'>“The bushes are thick all round us, and the
wood is very wild; and there is fruit on the
trees, and a little river near, where we may
drink. If we could but hide ourselves as long as
the sun is up, we might be safe for many days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cannot we pile up these big stones to make
a hiding-place, Willy? Set them one upon another
against this bank, and leave a hole behind
where we may creep in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy found this not very difficult. The hiding
place looked outside like a natural heap of
fragments of rock, while behind there was a hole
large enough for two people to sit upright; and
when some dry grass was shaken down to make
the ground soft, the runaway slaves thought they
could be content to remain in this narrow dwelling
for a long time. Willy laughed as he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.126'>126</span>not laughed since childhood, when he leaned
back in his dark corner, and Nell smiled as much
as the pain of her foot would let her. Hope had
already done her heart good. Twenty-four hours
sooner she would have made everybody near her
melancholy with her groans, for slaves are fond
of pity, and are made selfish by their wrongs;
but now, Nell began to feel like a free-woman.
She could procure no indulgence by complaint,
and she was grateful to her brother for his assistance
in making her escape. She therefore hoped
that he would sleep, and remained quite quiet
that she might not hinder his doing so. Perhaps
she would have attempted to sing a drowsy
song, if she had not been afraid of betraying
their retreat by permitting any sound to issue
from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her fit of patience lasted longer than might
have been expected from such a novice in the
virtue. For a few hours she sat bearing the pain
very well, and she might possibly have endured
for another if she had not heard, or fancied she
heard, a sound which made her heart throb as
painfully as her foot. The woods reposed in all
the stillness of noon, or she would have supposed
the sound to be some freak of the wind
among the high foliage of the forest; but
there was no wind, there was nothing to provoke
an echo; and her ears were struck by
something too like the distant, the very distant
baying of a hound. She laid her hand on her
brother’s arm. He did not stir. She paused to
listen again before she disturbed him. She had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.127'>127</span>not long to wait. It came again, nearer, and
too distinct to be mistaken. She shook the
sleeper.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Willy, Willy! hark to the hounds! The
hounds are after us!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy groaned as he started up, and shook
some of the stones overhead, which rolled down
with a great clatter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never mind that, Nell. We could not keep
under cover with the hounds upon us. O, if we
had but passed a stream in our way! If we could
but have baulked the hounds!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is a river below,” cried Nell; and
Willy was off at the word.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, Willy, Willy, do not leave me! I cannot
walk. O, carry me with you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy hesitated a moment as his worse and
better nature strove together. He came back for
his sister, took her on his back, and began to
scramble down to the stream. It was too late,
however. The shouts of men were now heard
mingling with the loud and louder baying of the
blood-hounds, which might be expected the next
moment to spring from the bushes upon their
victims. There was no hope of getting down to
the stream in time, much less of being hidden on
the opposite side. Willy cast a hurried look
behind him every moment; and when at last he
heard a rustling in the underwood, and saw fierce
eyes glaring upon him, he laid his burden on the
grass, crying,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nell, will you die or be a slave?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.128'>128</span>Nell grovelled on the earth and made no
answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will die!” shouted Willy, and was about
to spring into the water. His sister recalled him
by her cry.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Becky; poor Becky! She will be all alone
when our father dies.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Willy turned. What his choice would have
been cannot be known, for there was no time for
choice. Before the slave-hunters could come up
to see what happened, a fierce blood-hound had
sprung at Willy’s throat and brought him down.
Once having tasted blood, the animal was not
to be restrained by whistle, shouts or blows, till
the long death-grapple was over. When the
mangled negro had ceased to struggle, and lay
extended in his blood, the hound slunk back into
the bushes, licking his chops, and growling at
Nell as if he would make another spring if he dared.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remaining fugitive had no power to resist,
even if she had had the will. But her will was
annihilated. She had nothing to hope or to fear
in the present extremity of bodily and mental
misery. She sat quietly on the grass when they
tied her hands behind her back. She attempted
to walk when she was bid, and submitted to be
carried when it was found she could not stand.
She did not speak when they took up the body of
her brother from its bloody bed, nor start when
they tossed it into the stream, though splashed by
the plunge.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was conscious but of one passing impulse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.129'>129</span>during her journey back,—to throttle the man on
whose shoulders she was carried, as the hound had
throttled her brother: but the effort only served
to remind her that her arms were fastened. She
was asleep or in a stupor when brought back to
her hut, a circumstance which was pointed out
by a white as conclusive of the fact that negroes
have no feeling. As she was too lame to work,
however, and not in the best condition for the
lash, she was not roused. There was some
mercy in leaving her to find out for herself, when
she should again be able to collect her disordered
thoughts, that the brand and the stocks were
waiting for her, and that the days of her bondage
must henceforth be spent alone.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter XII.</span><br /> <br /> NO MASTER KNOWS HIS MAN IN DEMERARA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Though Alfred was mortified at the event of
his meeting with the planters, he had reason to
be satisfied on the whole with the result of his
present visit to Demerara. Now that poor Horner’s
opposition was at an end, it became comparatively
easy to carry two or three measures
about Mitchelson’s slaves that Alfred had much
at heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot give up the point of Cassius’s
freedom,” said he to Mitchelson. “I feel myself
pledged in honour to obtain it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.130'>130</span>“In honour! I will spare your honour, my
young friend, and never think the worse of you
if you forgot Cassius from this day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You!” exclaimed Alfred in astonishment.
“I am not pledged to you but to Cassius.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what should Cassius know about
honour?” asked Mitchelson, laughing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Call it humanity, if you please. Cassius
knows what humanity is; or, at any rate, what
liberty is: and since my employing him at the
mill-dam was the means at once of exciting his
hopes and raising his ransom, I cannot lose sight
of him till I lose sight of the vessel in which he
shall be sailing to Africa.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must keep a sharp look out then; for
he may be marched off south, or west, or east any
day. I can make nothing of him, and shall not
keep him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“South, or west, or east! I thought you said
he was promised to a planter in the neighbourhood?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He was; but the bargain is off. The fellow
was so idle and mulish the day that I wanted
him to show to the best advantage, that my friend
will not have him, unless for a lower price than
I mean to accept.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You had better take his ransom as it was
first fixed, and let him go. You will make
nothing of him at home or in the market after
what he has gone through lately.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am quite of your opinion, and would end
the business at once, but that a neighbour has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.131'>131</span>been talking to me about it, and convincing me
that it would be wrong.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wrong! how should it be wrong?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We planters determined long ago never to
admit the right of slaves to purchase their freedom.
We mean to keep it optional on our part
whether to sell them or not, in the same manner
as we deny the right of any one to make us sell
any other articles of our property. Now, so
much has been said about this particular slave,
Cassius, that my neighbours are afraid that, if I
let him go, advantage will be taken of the case
to represent that we can be obliged to part with
our slaves, like the Spanish planters. So you
see that, in justice to the West India interest,
I must refuse Cassius his freedom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I remember,” replied Alfred, “that some
reforms specified by an Order in Council were
objected to on the ground you have stated; and
the declaration is of a piece with all the declarations
with which government is insulted by the
landholders here. But though your neighbours
disregard equally the law of nature, the law of
God, and the ordinances of the government under
which they live, they admit, I believe, the
conventional law of honour, of which you think
Cassius can know nothing; they admit that a
gentleman must keep a promise, deliberately
made, and often repeated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A promise to a gentleman, certainly. Promises
to slaves are nothing, you know, if circumstances
alter, as they have done in this case.
The usages of society, for whose sake alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.132'>132</span>promises are made binding, bear no relation to
slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True enough,” said Alfred, smiling. “I
take you at your word, Mr. Mitchelson. You
have deliberately and repeatedly promised me
that Cassius should ransom himself at a certain
sum. That sum is now ready, and if you refuse
to take it and let the man go, I will expose your
breach of promise to every planter in Demerara.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Alfred! How strange of you to
treat an old friend so ceremoniously!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you will not grant my claim in a friendly
way, I must urge it ceremoniously. Tell me in
so many words, do you mean to keep your promise
or break it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I declare I am quite at a loss what to do.
My neighbours fully understand that the ransom
is refused.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That shall be no difficulty. I will tell them
that I have recalled to your memory a positive
promise to myself. I will take care of your
honour towards them, if you will take care of
it towards myself. And now let us go and
finish this business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure, my dear young friend, it always
gives me the greatest pleasure to oblige you, and
besides——”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred stopped short as he was walking, and
said, “We must understand one another better
before we have done. I cannot allow you to
think that you are doing an act of favour. It is
an act of very tardy justice to Cassius, and of
ungracious necessity towards myself. I am very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.133'>133</span>sorry to speak thus to an old friend, Mr. Mitchelson;
and no interests of my own should make
me thus fight my ground inch by inch; but for
the sake of the slaves I must deny that it is any
matter of favour to let a slave go free when he
offers his stipulated ransom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mitchelson muttered something about his
being unable to cut fine like his accomplished
young friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You cut fine just now,” replied Alfred, “on
behalf of the planters; you must allow me to do
the same on behalf of the slaves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They presently reached the spot where Cassius
was seemingly at work with others who were repairing
the devastation caused by the hurricane.
Alfred asked Cassius whether he still had money
to buy his ransom as at first fixed. He had.
How soon could he bring it in his hand and buy
his freedom? “Presently; in an hour; in five
minutes,” the slave said, as he saw the benevolent
smile broadening on Alfred’s face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fetch it then, and you and I will not part
till you sail away over the blue sea yonder.
Mr. Mitchelson, we will join you again presently,
and conclude the business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are not going with him, Alfred? He
will return sooner without you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Alfred determined to lose sight of his
charge no more till they should have quitted
Paradise.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius walked so rapidly that Alfred could
scarcely keep up with him. On reaching his
hut, a part of which had fallen in during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.134'>134</span>hurricane, he put his spade into Alfred’s hands,
pointing to a place where a heap of rubbish lay.
He fetched another spade for himself from a
neighbour’s hut, and began to dig among the
rubbish with might and main. Alfred worked
as hard as he, and neither had yet spoken a
word. They first uncovered the bed of planks
and mat on which the slave had spent so many
nights of desolate grief, and which had been so
often watered with his tears. Cassius, by a
sudden impulse, kicked these to as great a distance
as he could, snatched up a burning stick
from his fire, and kindled them. As the flame
shot up, he danced and sang till the last chip and
shred were burned. He then spat upon the ashes
and returned to his work.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little way under ground, beneath where the
bed had stood, a leathern pouch appeared. Cassius
seized it, showed Alfred with a rapid and
significant gesture that it was full of coin, and
marched straight towards the entrance of his
garden.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stay a moment,” said Alfred, laying his
hand on his shoulder; “you are not aware that
you will never come back to this place again.
Is there nothing here, nothing of your own, that
you wish to take with you? No clothes, no
tools, or utensils?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius looked about him with an expression
of intense disgust.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be prudent, Cassius. Your clothes and
your tools will not be the less useful to you in
Liberia because they belonged to you as a slave.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.135'>135</span>Cassius slowly returned and took up a few
articles, but presently seemed much disposed to
throw them into the fire.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, well,” said Alfred, “leave them where
they are, and if your master does not allow you
the value of them, I will. Now take one more
look at the dwelling where you have lived so
long, and then let us be gone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cassius had, however, no sentimental regrets
to bestow on the abode of his captivity. He
refused the last look, and strode away as an
escaped malefactor from the gibbet, without any
wish to look back. The first words he spoke
were uttered as he passed old Robert’s hut.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Little Hester will cry when she comes home
and finds that I am gone. Can you do nothing
for poor little Hester, Mr. Alfred?”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was exactly what Alfred was turning over
in his mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Cassius had told down his ransom with
Alfred’s assistance, when the necessary forms of
business were gone through, and the variety of
coins which the pouch contained were fairly
transferred to Mitchelson, Alfred said,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now that our affair of justice is concluded,
I am going to bring forward a matter of pure
favour.” Mr. Mitchelson, who liked granting
favours better than doing justice, looked very
gracious. Alfred explained, that by Cassius’s
departure, Hester would lose her only friend.
He begged that she might be taken from under
the charge of Robert and Sukey, and placed with
some one who would treat her kindly, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.136'>136</span>Mr. Mitchelson would himself inquire after the
friendless little girl from time to <a id='corr136.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='time'>time.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_136.2'><ins class='correction'>time.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“With the utmost pleasure, Alfred. I shall
always pay particular attention, I am sure, to
objects that interest you. But would you like to
purchase her? I am sorry that I cannot offer,
in the present state of my affairs, to give her to
you; but the demand shall be moderate if you
are disposed to purchase her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred was also sorry that the state of his own
and his father’s affairs was not such as could
justify his purchasing slaves. He would fain
have made this child free; but as he could not,
he consoled himself with the hope that he had
secured better treatment for her till he might be
able to render her a higher benefit still. Mr.
Mitchelson passed his word of honour that she
should that day be removed to the dwelling of a
gentle-tempered woman, who had lately lost a
daughter of about Hester’s age.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you nothing to say to me, Cassius?”
asked Mr. Mitchelson, as Cassius was turning
his back for ever upon his master’s mansion.
“Have you no farewell for me, so long as we
have lived together?”</p>

<p class='c001'>No, not any. Cassius cared little for good
manners just at this moment, and was only in
haste to be gone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lived together!” said Alfred to himself, as
he quitted Paradise. “These slaveholders never
dream that they may not use the language of the
employers of a free and reasonable service. An
English gentleman may speak to his household
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1.137'>137</span>servants of the time they have ‘lived together;’
but it is too absurd from the slaveholder who
despises his slave to the degraded being who
hates his owner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mitchelson meanwhile was wondering as much
at Alfred, thinking, as he watched them from the
steps of his mansion,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“That young man is a perfect Quixote, or
he could never see anything to care about in
such a sullen brute as Cassius. I am glad I
was never persuaded to send any of my children
to England. No man is fit to be a West Indian
planter who has had what is called a good education
in England.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As Alfred was crossing his father’s estate on
his way home, he met the overseer looking angry,
and with his anger was mingled some grief.
He was very ready to tell what was the matter. He
had just heard of the “unfortunate accident,”
by which Willy had been torn to pieces by bloodhounds.
When Alfred had made two strange discoveries,
he saw that nothing was to be made of
the overseer, and rode on. One discovery was, that
the man’s anger was against Willy himself for
the attempt at escape; the other, that he had
just blurted out the whole story to Mark in
Becky’s absence. Of course Alfred lost no
time in seeing if he could comfort the old man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mark was still alone when they went in, rocking
himself in his chair, and apparently aware
of what had happened, for he was singing, in a
faint wailing voice, a funeral song in his own
tongue.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.138'>138</span>He stopped when Alfred entered the hut,
Cassius remaining outside, and before he could
be prevented, rose from his seat, saying,</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am ready for the burial. I see them
waiting for me outside. Don’t stop me; I am
ready for the burial.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In attempting to move forwards, he fell heavily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Help, help!” cried Alfred to his companion.
“Lay him on the mat: sprinkle water on his
face; chafe his hands!”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was too late. He was gone. He was indeed
“ready for the burial.” Alfred waited for
Becky that he might give her the only comfort
in his power, in the hope that, now her filial cares
were ended, she might join her sister by the exchange
of the one or the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cassius has been climbing every hour since
sunrise, to where he may see the sea,” said Mr.
Bruce, laughing, to Alfred, on the day preceding
his return to Barbadoes. “He is like a school-boy
going home for the holidays.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To compare great things with small,” added
Alfred.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So you ship him with a party of your
own, and your neighbour’s liberated slaves, for
Liberia. How did you get leave? How did
you gain any interest with the American Colonization
Society?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our object being the same, father, there was
no difficulty in coming to an understanding.
We planters take upon ourselves the expense of
transportation, and the society receives our free
blacks under the protection of its agent at
Liberia.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.139'>139</span>“And what do you suppose will become of
them there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That which has become of the free blacks of
the United States who are settled there. They
will labour, and prosper and be happy. They
will become farmers, planters, merchants, or
tradespeople. They will make their own laws,
guard their own rights, and be as we are, men
and citizens.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you expect me to believe all this, son?
Do you think I know so little what blacks are?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Neither you nor I, father, can learn, in this
place, what Africans are in a better place. I
believe, and I certainly expect others to believe,
what I have told you, on the strength of sound
testimony. I wish you could once witness a
shipment for Liberia. It would confirm the
testimony wonderfully.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am aware, son, that there are powerful
emotions in the mind of a negro at the very
mention of Africa, or of the sea, or even of a
ship. When the importation of slaves was more
practised than it is now, the most endearing
name by which negroes called each other was
‘shipmate.’ If it was so endearing on their
being brought to a foreign country, I can fancy
that it must be yet more so, when they return to
their own. The little feeling that blacks have
is all spent upon their country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alfred shook his head, observing that he believed
nobody in Demerara was qualified to pronounce
on that point.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! not I, that have had to do with
negroes all my life?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.140'>140</span>“Do you remember the Canary bird that
Mary showed you when you were in England?”
was Alfred’s reply.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What the little pining thing that was kept
<a id='corr140.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='n'>in</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_140.5'><ins class='correction'>in</ins></a></span> the housekeeper’s room at the Grosvenor
Square house? O yes! Mary was very fond
of it, I remember.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mary gave that Canary its seed and water
for years, and she would have laughed if any one
had told her that she knew nothing about
Canary birds; but it would have been very true;
for that tame little creature, drawing up its tiny
bucket of water when it was bid, seeing the sunbeams
shut out as soon as ever it hailed them
with a burst of song, was not like one of the
same species with the wild, winged creatures that
flit about its native islands, and warble unchecked
till twilight settles down upon the
woods. And we, father, can never guess from
looking at a negro sulking in the stocks, or
tilling lands which yield him no harvest, what he
may be where there is no white man to fear and
hate, and where he may reap whatever he has
sown. Happily there are some who have been
to Liberia, and can tell us what a negro may
become.”</p>

  <h3 class='c017'>SUMMARY.</h3>
</div>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c015'>This volume, like the last, enlarges on principles
already laid down. It treats of the respective
values of different kinds of labour, and of a particular
mode of investing capital. The truths
illustrated may be arranged as follows.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Property</span> is held by conventional, not natural
right.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the agreement to hold man in property never
took place between the parties concerned, <i>i. e.</i>, is
not conventional, Man has no right to hold Man
in property.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Law</span>, <i>i. e.</i>, the sanctioned agreement of the
parties concerned, secures property.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where the parties are not agreed, therefore,
law does not secure property.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where one of the parties under the law is held
as property by another party, the law injures the
one or the other as often as they are opposed.
Moreover, its very protection injures the protected
party,—as when a rebellious slave is
hanged.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c001'>Human labour is more valuable than brute
labour, only because actuated by reason; for
human strength is inferior to brute strength.</p>

<p class='c001'>The origin of labour, human and brute, is the
Will.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Reason of slaves is not subjected to exercise,
nor their will to more than a few weak
motives.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.142'>142</span>The labour of slaves is therefore less valuable
than that of brutes, inasmuch as their strength
is inferior; and less valuable than that of free
labourers, inasmuch as their Reason and Will are
feeble and alienated.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c001'>Free and slave labour are equally owned by the
capitalist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where the labourer is not held as capital, the
capitalist pays for labour only.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where the labourer is held as capital, the capitalist
not only pays a much higher price for an
equal quantity of labour, but also for waste, negligence,
and theft, on the part of the labourer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Capital is thus sunk, which ought to be reproduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the supply of slave-labour does not rise and
fall with the wants of the capitalist, like that of
free labour, he employs his occasional surplus on
works which could be better done by brute labour
or machinery.</p>

<p class='c001'>By rejecting brute labour, he refuses facilities
for convertible husbandry, and for improving the
labour of his slaves by giving them animal food.</p>

<p class='c001'>By rejecting machinery, he declines the most
direct and complete method of saving labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, again, capital is sunk which ought to
be reproduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to make up for this loss of capital to
slave owners, bounties and prohibitions are granted
in their behalf by government; the waste committed
by certain capitalists abroad, being thus
paid for out of the earnings of those at home.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1.143'>143</span>Sugar being the production especially protected,
everything is sacrificed by planters to the growth
of sugar. The land is exhausted by perpetual
cropping, the least possible portion of it is tilled
for food, the slaves are worn out by overwork,
and their numbers decrease in proportion to the
scantiness of their food, and the oppressiveness
of their toil.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the soil is so far exhausted as to place
its owner out of reach of the sugar-bounties,
more food is raised, less toil is inflicted, and the
slave population increases.</p>

<p class='c001'>Legislative protection, therefore, not only taxes
the people at home, but promotes ruin, misery,
and death, in the protected colonies.</p>

<p class='c001'>A free trade in sugar would banish slavery
altogether, since competition must induce an
economy of labour and capital; i. e., a substitution
of free for slave labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us see, then, what is the responsibility of
the legislature in this matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The slave system inflicts an incalculable amount
of human suffering, for the sake of making a
wholesale waste of labour and capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since the slave system is only supported by
legislative protection, the legislature is responsible
for the misery caused by direct infliction, and for
the injury indirectly occasioned by the waste of
labour and capital.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span> <br /> <br /> LANDLORD AND TENANT.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Among the islands which are clustered around
the western shore of Argyleshire, there is a small
chain called the Garveloch Isles, or the Isles of
Rough Rock. There are four of them, divided
from the coast of Lorn by a tossing sea, and by
scattered islands larger than themselves; and
from each other by narrow sounds, studded with
rocks, and difficult to navigate, on account of
the force of their currents. This difficulty would
have placed the inhabitants nearly out of reach
of intercourse with those of the mainland, even
if that intercourse had been desired by either
party; but it was not, at the date of our narrative,
for they knew and cared little about each
other. The islanders, consisting of only a few
families scattered over Garveloch, (the principal
of the group, which therefore gives it name to
the whole,) thought of nothing but providing as
they could for themselves alone; and their place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.2'>2</span>of habitation was so wild and dreary that it presented
was the only inhabited island of the four; Ilachanu,
the westermost and next largest, being a
desert of rocks and moorland; and the easternmost,
considerably smaller, not having even yet
received the poor distinction of a name.</p>

<p class='c001'>The length of Garveloch is about a mile and a
half; but its dwellers were, in the days of our tale,
as little acquainted with each other’s concerns as
if a chain of mountains had divided the north-eastern
from the south-western parts of their
island. The difficulties which lay in the way of
their intercourse were so great from the nature
of the land,—it being divided by steep rocks into
cliffs and narrow valleys which were almost impassable,—that
the rare communication which
did take place was by coasting when the weather
was calm enough to render the Sound safe for
the crazy boats and small skill of the islanders.
These boats were but two; one belonging to a
farmer who cultivated his sandy fields on the
southernmost and sunniest part of the land, and
the other to the family of a fisherman who had
tenanted a good cottage and croft on the shore
some way higher up. These boats were borrowed
as they were wanted; and the intercourse of
lending and receiving back again was all that
ever took place, except on the rare occasions of
a marriage, a birth, or a funeral, or the still
rarer one of a visit from the proprietor. These
visits averaged about one in the lifetime of each
laird; for if it chanced that any one of the race
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.3'>3</span>was so fond of the wildest kind of scenery, or so
addicted to any pursuit in which the productions
of these islands could assist him, as to show his
face a second time to his amazed tenantry, it as
often happened that another was kept away entirely
by the reports of those who had no love of
dreary lands and perilous waters.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are traces in all the islands of times
when they had been more frequented; of times
when the first introduction of a new faith into
this remote region was followed up by rites
which must have given to it an aspect of civilization
which it had now long lost. Tombs of gray
stone, with a cross at the head of each, are conspicuous
here and there; and in the most secluded
parts are mouldering walls which seem to have
formed hermitages in the olden times. If these
establishments were, as is most probable, connected
with the cathedral of Iona, it seems
strange that so great a celebrity as they must
have obtained should have died away. There is
not so much as one tradition, however obscure,
among the inhabitants, respecting these relics,
and they therefore afford the less interest to the
traveller, who can only look at the remains and
go away as wise as he came.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was once a laird, however, who was not
willing to give up the whole matter as a mystery
without examination. He came again and again,
sometimes attended only by his steward, and
sometimes by strangers as curious as himself.
He destroyed the average we have spoken of,
greatly to the joy of his island tenantry, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.4'>4</span>the annoyance of the old steward who had the
charge of this range of islands, together with
many more in the neighbouring seas, and who
much preferred talking big in the name of the
laird, and doing what he pleased among the
people, to following his principal in his excursions,
standing by to hear the statements of the
tenantry, and receiving directions concerning
their affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Notice of a visit from the laird was sometimes
given and sometimes not, according as Callum,
the steward, happened to be in Garveloch or
elsewhere. He had an apartment of his own at
the farm above-mentioned, which he occupied
sometimes for a few days together, and which
was therefore better furnished with accommodations
than any other space between four walls
in the island. The convenience of having this
apartment prepared in case of the weather being
too boisterous to permit a return on the same
day to the mainland, induced the proprietor to
send notice when Callum was on the spot to
make arrangements. When he was not, such
notice served no purpose, as the people at the
farm had no power to levy supplies, and would
not have known how to use them when procured,
so uncivilized were their habits and manners.
On one occasion, the omission of such notice
caused the laird to witness a sight which he had
never before beheld in all its simplicity,—a funeral
among his tenants.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the bark which contained himself and a
party of friends approached Garveloch, one fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.5'>5</span>spring morning, he saw two boats nearing the
landing-place before them. As these vessels were
rocked in the surf, snatches of a hoarse and wild
music came from them, rising above the roar and
dash of the waves. The sound was not that of
any instrument, but of the rough voices of men,
and it ceased when the labours of landing began.
This was done with all possible awkwardness,
confusion and noise, and then the companies of
the two boats took their way up the rocks without
perceiving the laird’s vessel, which was still
at a considerable distance. Some of the men
bore on their shoulders the body about to be interred,
and the rest followed at their own pace,
not forming themselves into any order of march,
or seeming to be united by any common object.
The last of the stragglers disappeared behind a
projection of the rock, while the laird was preparing
to be carried through the surf by two of
his boatmen. He pointed out to them, with great
exactness, the spot where they should land the
rest of the party when they should return from
Ilachanu to join him at dinner, and then took his
way alone in the track of the funeral party.</p>

<p class='c001'>He reached the burying-ground just as the
ceremony was concluded; for funerals in the
Highlands are hurried over with an apparent
negligence and levity which shock the feelings of
those who have been accustomed to the solemnity
which such a service seems fitted to inspire.
The only solemnity here arose from the desolation
of the place. It was unenclosed, so that the
wild cattle had gone over it, defacing the tombstones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.6'>6</span>and cropping the coarse herbage which
grew more plentifully here than elsewhere.
Thistles and docks appeared where there were
some traces of a path, and the fragments of
broken crosses lay as rubbish beside the newly-dug
grave. The laird looked among the group
for the mourners. They were easily distinguished
by their countenances, though they shed
no tears and spoke no word. They were three
boys, the two elder of whom were strong, ruddy,
well-grown youths, apparently of the ages of
sixteen and fourteen. The third was either some
years younger, or was made to look so by his
smallness of size and delicacy of appearance.
He fixed the attention of the laird at once by the
signs of peculiarity about him. His restlessness
of eye and of manner was unlike that which
arises in children from animal spirits, and contrasted
strangely with the lost and melancholy
expression of his countenance. His brothers
seemed not to forget him for a moment, sometimes
holding him by the hand to prevent his
wandering from them, sometimes passing an arm
round his neck to control his restlessness, sometimes
speaking to him in the caressing tone
which they would use to an infant. The laird,
learning from some who passed out of the burying-ground
that these boys were orphans, and had
been attending the funeral of their father, determined
to learn more about them from themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You three are brothers, I find. Which of
you is the eldest?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.7'>7</span>“I am two years older than Fergus,” answered
Ronald, “and Archie is twelve, though
he looks less.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And have you any brothers and sisters
younger than you, Archie?” enquired the laird.</p>

<p class='c001'>Archie looked in the gentleman’s face for a
moment, and then away again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He speaks to nobody but us,” said Ronald.
“He heeds no other voice,—that is, no man’s
or woman’s voice. He knows the low of the
cattle and the cry of the sea-fowl when a storm is
coming. He wants to be down among the rocks
now, ye see. We’re going, Archie, we’re going.
Stay a minute.—He’s not like us, your honour
sees.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see, I see. He looks quite lost.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To a stranger,” said Fergus, “but not to
us. We know his ways so well that we can always
guide him, except when he is at the highest
and lowest, and then it is best to leave him to
himself till the fit is over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He must require a great deal of watching;
is there no one to take care of him but you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He takes to no folly, only to sport, Sir; and
he is wiser than we about many things, and sees
farther. He is always housed before a tempest,
or safe in a hole in the rock, like the birds he
seems to learn from, while we breast the wind as
we may, far from home. When he is dull or
low, Ella takes better care of him than we could
do. She just puts fresh heather under him and
sings, and he sleeps sometimes many days together.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.8'>8</span>“And who is Ella?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our sister, your honour; our elder sister.
She is down by the boats, and she will be glad
to see your honour, for we have much to say to
you or to Mr. Callum. Where will your honour
please to see Ella?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We will walk down to the boats, Ronald;
or, if your sister should wish to speak with me
more privately, perhaps she will come up here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald cast a hurried look at the new-made
grave, and then said to Fergus,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Run down, Fergus, and ask Ella to come up
to the cross yonder. The laird will wait for her
there: and let Archie go with you; he is in a
hurry for the shore.”</p>

<p class='c001'>During the few minutes that they waited at
the cairn or heap of stones in which the cross
was planted, the laird learned from his companion
something of the domestic circumstances
of this orphan family. Their mother had died
at Archie’s birth, and their father had been
growing infirm for many years, so that almost
the whole charge of the family had rested upon
Ella since she had been old enough to support it.
Her brother praised her only by stating facts;
but these facts conveyed an impression that she
must be a woman of extraordinary energy, and
one who deserved all the respect and love with
which her brothers could regard her. It was
very natural that, while listening to a tale of
peculiar interest concerning her, the laird should
picture her to himself as corresponding in outward
appearance to the elevated idea which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.9'>9</span>given him of her character; and it was with
some disappointment that he looked upon her for
the first time. She appeared as much older than
she really was, as Archie looked younger. She
might have been taken for his mother, though
she was, in fact, no more than five-and-twenty.
Tall and gaunt in person, and thinking as little
of adornment in dress as her country-women in
general, on ordinary occasions, there was nothing
at first sight to attract a stranger. Her
feet were bare, according to the universal custom;
her hair, unconfined by any cap, hanging
down from under the plaid which she had drawn
over her head, the plaid itself strapped round her
in preparation for rowing her boat home, she
looked so unlike the maidens of a civilized country,
that the laird, well as he knew his own
tenantry, was startled. When he looked again,
however, and observed the strong expression of
her eye, and of her weather-stained features,
when he remembered what toils she had undergone,
and that her heart was now troubled and
striving with natural grief, he felt that he was
wrong in expecting softness where it was not to
be found.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you anything to say to me, Ella;
any complaint to make?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No complaint, your honour. Murmurs will
not heal the grief of this day, and other troubles
are nothing. I only wished to speak to your
honour about the lads and myself; how we are
to live and what to do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; have you settled what you wish? and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.10'>10</span>is there difficulty with Callum, or any body
else?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your honour knows our farm, where we
have lived till now. Mr. Callum has given
notice whenever he found my father ill, that we
must quit it at his death. So we are going to
quit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what else would you do? Your brothers
are not old enough to manage a farm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Callum is right, doubtless; and I have
no desire to keep on what we could not keep up.
As for where we are to go,—we should be quite
easy in mind, if your honour would order the
place down below to be made weather-tight for
us, and fix a rent upon it. Your honour would
not ask more than we could pay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, that half-ruined cottage in the bay,
with the croft behind it! How could you live
there? There is not a fence complete, and not
an ear of barley has grown there these many
years.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your honour would have the fences mended
at the same time with the cottage; and there
is the fishing to depend on, as well as the
ground, and the rocks shelve conveniently
there for the weed, and Ronald could sell kelp
when I sell fish; and Fergus could bring us in
peat,—and as for Archie, the nearer the sea, the
happier he is. So I hope your honour will let
us try the place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a wretched place, Ella. I think we
might find something better for you. There
are patches of richer soil in the vallies. Surely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.11'>11</span>you had better settle in a more sheltered situation.
The wind will blow away your soil and
seed together before it has time to strike root.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We cannot get out of sight of the sea, on
Archie’s account, sir.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He would never be happy between green
hills,” added Fergus. “We should ever be missing
him from home, and finding him in the old
places: but if we settle on the beach, he will not
be tempted to stray.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Though he could not stray very far, your
honour, I am easier to have him under my eye,
which might be, if I lived by fishing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is scarcely a woman’s business, Ella.
It brings toil and hardship to the strongest men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is my business, your honour; and it is
not the blackest night, nor the stormiest day,
that can weary me, thanks to Him that gives
strength where it is wanted. Would you be
pleased to grant me what I ask, and let me know
with your own lips, what the rent shall be?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us go to the place, and see what it looks
like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>While they proceeded down the steep to the
beach, Ella leading the way, the laird marked her
stern demeanour and masculine gait, and could
not fancy her singing her idiot brother to sleep,
and couching him on fresh heather. Presently,
however, his idea of her was amended. Archie
came sauntering along the shore to join them,
and yet with every appearance of not observing
them. He held a bunch of sea-bird’s feathers,
which he thrust into Ella’s hand without looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.12'>12</span>at her, but glanced back when he had passed, as
if to see what had become of them. Ella had
thrown back the plaid and stuck them in her hair,
where they remained till he was out of sight,
when she threw them away and resumed her plaid.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The people at the farm are relations of yours,
I think, Ella?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are fourth cousins of my mother’s;
and disposed to be kind to us for her sake: and
that is another reason for our settling here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what will they think of such a dreary
place in comparison with their barley and oat
fields, to say nothing of the house, with two
rooms, each as large as this cottage, besides
Callum’s apartment?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is what we think that matters most.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very true. Now show me the boundaries
that you would mark out if you had your choice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The rent will mark the boundary best: but
we should like, besides this field, to have the
slope of the hill behind for our pony to graze on.
We must have the pony to carry the weed, and
to draw the harrow, in case of my being out at
sea at the time. And I should like to take in a
corner of the peat moss yonder; that is all we
wish for behind. Then Ronald must be free to
cut weed some way along these ledges to the
left: they shelve better than those on the other
hand. Then the cottage should be new roofed,
and the fence put up; and your honour will name
the rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You shall not be pressed for that, Ella. It
would not be reasonable in a situation like this.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.13'>13</span>“I hope your honour sees we beg no favour,”
replied Ella. “Ask Mr. Callum, and he will tell
you our rent has ever been ready, whether we
feasted or fasted: and ready it shall be, if it be
God’s will to let the sea and land yield us their
own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Better to fast and pay, than feast and owe,”
said Fergus.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Right, very right, Fergus. Well; you shall
have your way; and I will consult with Callum
about the rent, and have the place made ready
as quickly as possible. Here he is. Let one
of the lads come up to me at the farm, an hour
or two hence, and I will name the rent; meantime,
you can join your friends.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Instead of going towards the boats, however,
Ella slowly proceeded up the rocks, in the direction
of the burying-ground. The lads looked as
if they would fain have stayed to listen; but a
glance from their sister sent Fergus to look for
Archie, and Ronald to join the little funeral party,
who were carousing as if it had been a wedding.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There will be tears in those eyes within these
few minutes, if there is nobody nigh,” said Callum,
looking after Ella as he came up. “They
have held tears, for as dry as they seem. Since
her father began to fail, I, for one, have seen
heart-drops, though she would have had me think
it was but the wintry wind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She has a proud spirit, Callum.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Proud! her pride ill becomes one that lives
under your honour, and it is more than I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.14'>14</span>how to master. There is no bringing her down;
and if she puts her spirit into her brothers, they
will be beyond my reach quite.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you mean, Callum? Why should
you bring them down?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only to make them like others that live under
such as you,—grateful and humble, and ready
to obey.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To obey your pleasure, I suppose. No Callum,
there has been far too much servile obedience
among the lower orders of our people,
one sign of which is their revengeful and turbulent
temper. If they were less ready to watch
our pleasure in matters that do not concern them,
they would do fewer deeds that call for revenge,
and have fewer causes of quarrel. This proud
woman, as we call her, has a peaceable temper,
I hope and believe?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Peaceable enough, your honour, or I own I
should have picked a quarrel with her before now,
for I do not like her any more than I fancy she
likes me. But there has never been occasion
for any words; for out comes the pouch as sure
as I show myself to gather the rent; and there
is the dinner and the whiskey on the table for
me to take or leave, as I like. She never kept
me waiting, or stinted her hospitality, or got into
a quarrel with her neighbours that I could take
hold of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then for what, in the name of wonder, Callum,
would you have her be grateful and ready to
obey? I never did her any service that I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.15'>15</span>aware of, (though I hope to do some yet,) and
I know of no title to her obedience that either
you or I can urge. Can you tell me of any?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Callum stared, while he asked if one party was
not landlord and the other tenant.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are full of our Scotch prejudices, I see,
Callum, as I was once. Only go into England,
and you will see that landlord and tenant are
not master and slave, as we in the Highlands
have ever been apt to think. In my opinion,
their connexion stands thus,—and I tell it you,
that you may take care not to exact an obedience
which I am far from wishing to claim from my
tenants,—the owner and occupier of a farm, or
other estate, both wish to make gain, and for
this purpose unite their resources. He who
possesses land wishes to profit by it without the
trouble of cultivating it himself; he who would
occupy has money, but no land to lay it out
upon, so he pays money for the use of the land,
and more money for the labour which is to till
it (unless he supplies the labour himself). His
tillage should restore him his money with gain.
Now why should the notion of obedience enter
into a contract like this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I only know,” replied Callum, “that in my
young days, if the laird held up a finger, any
one of his people who had offended him would
have been thrown into the sea.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such tyranny, Callum, had nothing to do
with their connexion as landlord and tenant, but
only with their relation as chieftain and follower.
You have been at Glasgow, I think?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.16'>16</span>“Yes; a cousin of mine is a master in the
shawl-manufacture there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; he has labourers in his employment
there, and they are not his slaves, are they?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not they; for they sometimes throw up
their work when he wants them most.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And does he hold his warehouse by lease, or
purchase?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He rents it of Bailie Billie, as they call him,
who is so fierce on the other side of politics.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If your cousin does not obey his landlord in
political matters, (for I know how he has spoken
at public meetings,) why should you expect my
tenants to obey me, or rather you—for I never
ask their obedience? The Glasgow operative,
and the Glasgow capitalist, make a contract for
their mutual advantage; and if they want further
help, they call in another capitalist to afford them
the use of a warehouse which he lets for his own
advantage. Such a mutual compact I wish to
establish with my people here. Each man of
them is usually a capitalist and labourer in one,
and, in order to make their resources productive,
I, a landholder, step in as a third party to the
production required; and if we each fulfil our
contract, we are all on equal terms. I wish
you would make my people understand this;
and I require of you, Callum, to act upon it
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The steward made no reply, but stood thinking
how much better notions of dignity the old
laird had, and how much power he possessed
over the lives and properties of his tenants.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.17'>17</span>“Did this croft pay any rent before it was let
out of cultivation?” enquired the laird.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, your honour; it only just answered to
the tenant to till it, and left nothing over for
rent; but we had our advantage in it too; for
then yon barley-field paid a little rent; but since
this has been let down, that field has never done
more than pay the tillage. But we shall have rent
from it again when the lease is renewed, if Ella
makes what I expect she will make of this croft.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is there any kelp prepared hereabouts,
Callum?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not any; and indeed there is no situation
so fit for it as this that Ronald is to have. There
is nothing doing in Garveloch that pays us anything,
except at the farm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, then, Ella can, of course, pay nothing
at first but for the use of the cottage, and the
benefit of the fences, &amp;c. Is there any other
capital laid out here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us see. She has a boat of her own, and
the boys will bring their utensils with them.
I believe, sir, the house and fence will be all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very well: then calculate exactly what they
are worth, and what more must be laid out to
put them in good condition, and tell me; the
interest of that much capital is all that Ella
must pay, till we see what the bay and the little
field will produce.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The laird next gave particular directions what
repairs should be made, and that there should be
no delay in completing them, and then left Callum
to make his estimate, bidding him follow to
the farm when he had done.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span> <br /> <br /> A HIGHLAND FARM.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>There was such a bustle at the farm as had not
been seen for many a day. At the first alarm
of company landing, the girls of the family unyoked
themselves from the harrow which they
were drawing over the light, sandy soil, and
hastened into the house, where their mother had
already begun her preparations. One of them
set about fanning the smouldering peat fire with
the torn skirt of her woollen petticoat, while the
other climbed upon the settle to take down one
of the regiment of smoked geese which hung
overhead from a pole, in somewhat the same
kind of arrangement in which they had once
winged their flight through the upper air. Lean,
black, and coarse, the bird would have been little
tempting to the appetite of a stranger; but as
all the approaching company were not strangers,
it stood a fair chance of being eaten with relish.
The mother, while calling to one or another to
bring out a cheese from the press, and barley-cakes
from the cupboard, was now engaged in
bringing potatoes to light from under her own
bed, and taking off the cream from pans which
were hidden from common observation by a
curtain of peat-smoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>The goose being set to boil, and the potatoes
ready to be put into the same pot in due time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.19'>19</span>(possibly in order that the oil from the bird
might save the trouble of buttering them when
they came to table,) the readiest of the two
maidens hastened to exhibit the snow-white
cloth of ancient home manufacture, which covered,
on rare festivals, the table in Callum’s apartment.
By the time it was spread out to view, it
displayed, besides all its varieties of pattern, a
further diversity, not intended by the original
designer. Here a streak of yellow oil imbibed
from the goose; there a brush of mould from
a potatoe; here a few harmless drops of cream,
and there a corner dabbled in more fragrant
whisky, were all new for the occasion. The
next thing to be done, was to unpack the baskets
of provisions which, out of consideration for
the stomachs of the strangers, had been sent in
the boat by the laird’s housekeeper. What
jostling of helpers, what jingling of bottles, what
spilling of everything that could be spilt, what
soiling of all that was solid! It was well for
those who were to eat, that they saw nothing of
this household preparation; if they had, neither
the fresh sea-breeze, nor the exercise they had
taken, would have availed to give a relish to their
meal. To beguile the impatience they began to
feel for their dinner, some surveyed the farm,
some seated themselves on a bench beside the
door, to regale their eyes with the splendid
view of sea and islands which presented itself:
and these occasionally conversed with the
farmer’s sons,—two boys, who stood staring at a
little distance, and were, after much perseverance,
prevailed upon to speak.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.20'>20</span>“What is your name?” asked a lady of the
younger boy.</p>

<p class='c001'>He put three fingers in his mouth and stared,
but made no reply; and it was some minutes
before it appeared that his name was Rob.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; now you have told me your own name,
tell me the name of that island, that looks so
black with the shadow of the cloud upon it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s Ilachanu.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no. Ilachanu lies the other way, and
we have just come from it. Use your eyes, my
man. How should you know which I mean if
you stand with your back to it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s Garveloch, maybe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay; this is Garveloch that we stand upon.
One would think it had no name, by the little
you know about it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It has not any name,” cried the boy brightening.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; why could not you say so before?
Do you ever go there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have been there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you go there for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father takes me in the boat.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what do you do when you get there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We go and then we come back again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose so: but do you fish, or get eggs,
or visit your friends, or what?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rob laughed, stared, and then looked at his
brother, who conveyed with some trouble that
nobody lived there. The lady next tried to make
something of him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you go to that desert island for,
my lad?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.21'>21</span>“Why was you wanting to know?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only out of curiosity. If your errand there
is a secret, say so, and I will not ask you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The boy laughed, and said they went sometimes
for one thing and sometimes for another;
and this was all that could be made out.—What
was the distance? was the next question.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It may be twelve mile.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Twelve! it cannot be so much surely.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maybe ’tis five.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not believe it is more than two.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, I’m thinking ye’re right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not seem to know much about the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, I know nothing about it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And so forth, upon every subject started: nor
did their father appear much more enlightened
in his way.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The cattle seem to have done your field a
world of mischief,” observed an English gentleman,
“and no wonder, with such a pretence
of a fence as that. How long has it been broken
down?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed I can’t remember.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not this year, or last,” said his landlord,
“for I remember advising you three seasons ago
to make your boys clear the ground of these
stones, which would have built up your wall
presently.—You said you would, and I suppose
you still mean to do it some day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O aye, some day; and I have spoken to
the lads many a time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Speaking does not seem to have done much
good.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.22'>22</span>“Indeed, your honour’s right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Set about it yourself, I advise you, and then
perhaps they will work with you, if you can’t
prevail upon them by other means.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maybe I will some day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see no stock except a shaggy pony or two,
or the few black cattle on the moor there,” observed
the English gentleman.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are both pigs and poultry, if you
could find out where they are,” said the laird
laughing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gentleman looked round in vain, and then
applied to farmer Murdoch himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do ye think we’ve no more cattle than
them?” asked he proudly. “There are many
more of the kine down below fishing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cattle fishing! What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I just mean what I say,—the kine are getting
fish for themselves in the pools below, and
the pigs——”</p>

<p class='c001'>The laird explained to his friend that all domestic
animals, even horses, relish fish when
their other food is poor of its kind; and that it
is the custom of the native cattle to go down
to the beach at low water, and help themselves
out of the pools in which fish have been left by
the retiring tide.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Murdoch; and your pigs and poultry,—where
are they? Do your pigs live on wild
ducks, and your fowls on sea-weed?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Na, na,” said Murdoch. “Where should
they be but yonder? Ye’ll see them when ye go
in to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! in the house?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.23'>23</span>“To be sure,” said the laird. “As soon as
you enter, the pig will run between your legs,
and the fowls will perch upon each shoulder, and
then you will be asked where the poor beasts
could be better. If ever accident should oblige
you to sleep in a farm-house hereabouts, examine
your bed lest a sucking-pig should have taken
possession before you, and in the morning, look
for eggs in your shoes before you slip your feet
into them.—But see, you must make acquaintance
with these domestics out of doors for once.
Here comes the old grunter, and there are the
fowls fluttering as if they liked the day-light no
better than bats.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In honour of the guests, the house was cleared
of live stock, and their banishment was a sign
that dinner was ready at last.—The meal was
conducted with tolerable decency, as in addition
to the boatmen who waited on the guests, Callum
had arrived to keep things in order, and do
the honours of his apartment. By dint of swearing
at one, flinging his Highland bonnet at
another, and coaxing a third, he procured a
change of trenchers, when his guests turned
from fish to fowl, and thence to cheese. This
change did not much matter to those who ate of
the provisions of the farm-house, for everything
had a smack of the sea. The cream was fishy,
the cheese was fishy, and the barley bannocks
themselves had a salt and bitter flavour as if they
had been dipped in sea-water; so at least the
English gentlemen thought, remembering how
the cattle fed, and having seen the land manured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.24'>24</span>with sea-weed. As it was certainly pure fancy as
far as the barley-cakes were concerned, it might
have been so in the other cases; but he turned
with much greater relish to the provisions which
had been brought from the mainland.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella arrived before the meal was over, and
waited outside till the laird could speak with her.
His first question, when he took his seat on the
bench beside the door, and his tenant stood
before him, was, what had made her brothers so
unlike the boys within, and most of the other lads
belonging to the islands? He knew that they
had been early taught industry by their father’s
example; but who had instructed them to husband
that industry, to make use of eyes, ears,
and understanding as well as limbs? Who had
made them intelligent and skilful as well as
laborious?</p>

<p class='c001'>“How does your honour know they are so?”
asked Ella, for once following the Highland
fashion of answering one question by another.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I saw at a glance that they were intelligent,
and Ronald told me enough while we were waiting
for you to show that you know better how to
live with a little than these cousins of yours with
much. How did you all learn?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did Ronald tell you about Angus?” asked
Ella, her eye for the first time sinking under that
of the laird.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Merely that Angus taught you the management
of a boat, as he had learned it in dangerous
places abroad. Angus is a relation, I suppose,
or only a friend?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.25'>25</span>“A friend; and he taught us all many things
that are little thought of here. My father ever
said we should do well if we had Angus at hand
to advise us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose he will come and advise you again,
Ella, at such an important time as this. Will
you not send for him? Can I carry any message
to the mainland, for I hear that it was from
over the water that he used to come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella answered in a somewhat stern voice, that
if ever he came again it must be from over the
water, for that he had been in foreign parts for
five years, and nothing had been heard of him
for long.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Five years! then he could not have taught her
brothers much, so young as they must have been
when he went away.” Ella replied that he taught
her whatever her father could not, and her
brothers learned of her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps,” said the laird, “if his friends
expected to hear of him, something prevented
his sending to them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt,” replied Ella.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you imagine it could be, Ella?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps he is dead,” said she quietly, but
still looking on the ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not suppose he has forgotten his old
friends? yet, such things do sometimes happen,
Ella.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She made no answer; and the laird saw by the
deep colour which made itself seen through her
weather-worn complexion, that he had gone too
far. He was very sorry; and now wondered at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.26'>26</span>his own slowness in perceiving the true state of
the case; but there was so little in her appearance
to suggest the idea, and she seemed so
wholly devoted to her brothers, that he had
fancied the connexion with Angus one of pure
friendship,—of that friendship which bears in the
Highlands a character of warmth, simplicity, and
familiarity, not very common in some other
places.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr26.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“To'>To</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_26.9'><ins class='correction'>To</ins></a></span> relieve Ella, the laird spoke immediately
of business, relating what was to be done to make
the cottage and field tenantable, and explaining
to her that, twenty shillings a year being the
interest upon the capital laid out, twenty shillings
a year was the sum he would take, if she
thought she could pay it.—Ella had no doubt of
it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Try it for a year,” said the laird, “and then
if either party is discontented, we can change
our terms. I hope you will meet with no disturbance
from any one, and that you may find all
your little plans answer well, so that you may be
able to pay rent whenever the time comes for
neighbours to settle down beside you and increase
the cost of the place you hold. That
time will come, I give you warning; and when
it comes, I hope you will be rich enough to meet
it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely, your honour, we hope to improve
the land, and so to be able to pay more than for
the fencing; but how are we to improve the sea,
or the ledges where we cut weed?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You cannot improve them, Ella; but if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.27'>27</span>are in a more favourable situation than your
neighbours for obtaining their produce, you must
expect to pay for the advantage. If I were to
ask a rent to-day for the fishing in your bay,
neither you nor others would pay it; you would
say ‘I will go to some other situation as good,
where there is no rent to pay,’ and you would
settle yourself down in Ilachanu or elsewhere,
and keep all you could obtain. But when all
these best situations are taken possession of,
other comers say to me, ‘We will pay you a part
of what we get if you will let us have a line of
shore that shelves conveniently for our kelping,
or where fish is plentiful.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then,” said Ella, “we must pay as much
as they offer, if we mean to stay; or take up with
a worse situation if we will not pay. Well; I
doubt not we can pay your honour duly when that
time comes, over and above the twenty shillings
for the house and fences. It may be in fish or kelp,
instead of money, but we will manage to pay, if
Mr. Callum be not hard upon us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall tell Callum to receive my interest in
any shape that it may suit you best to pay it; in
fish, or in kelp, or in grain, or even in peat. This
is but fair considering how far you are from any
market. As for the real rent, do not trouble
your head about that at present. It will be long
before you will be called on for any; and I only
mentioned it to show you what you have to expect
if you grow rich.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will our growing rich make us liable to pay
what your honour calls real rent? You will excuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.28'>28</span>my asking, but I like to know what is before
us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your growing rich will tempt people to come
and try their fortune; and then, as I said, the
best situations must pay for being the best. Is
not this fair?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure; your honour would not ask any
thing unfair.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is not enough, Ella. If there should
be a new laird by that time—”</p>

<p class='c001'>“God forbid!” exclaimed Ella. “A new laird
would not come to Garveloch in this way, like
your honour, or listen to what your people have
to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But answer me,” said the laird, smiling,
“Would you object to pay rent, in the case I
speak of, whoever might be laird?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely no,” replied Ella, “unless I could
better myself by moving; which I could not do if
all situations as good as my own were taken up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how much would you be willing to pay?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let’s see. If we had over and above, at
the end of the year, two barrels of herrings and
half a ton of kelp, we’ll say,—I would find out
how much we should have over and above, in the
same time, in the next best place; and if it was
one barrel of herrings and a quarter of a ton of
kelp, I would pay the difference,—that is one
barrel of herrings and a quarter of a ton of kelp,
rather than <a id='corr28.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='move.'>move.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_28.30'><ins class='correction'>move.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“Very right; and then you would be as well
off in the one place as in the other. There would
still be a fair profit on both.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.29'>29</span>“And I am sure your honour would not ask
more than our profits would come to.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There would be little use in my asking, even
if I wished it, Ella; for it would not be paid.
Your neighbour would not settle beside you, unless
the place answered to him; and if I demanded
more of you than the difference between your
profits and his, you would, of course, move to a
situation like his?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should be sorry to move,” said Ella, looking
downwards to her new place of abode, “but,
in such a case, I must.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such a case will not occur, Ella; for we are
not so foolish as to let our farms and cottages
stand empty from our asking more rent than they
can pay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not afraid, sir, of having to give up our
place. Whenever there is a rent, it will be small
at first, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, and it will grow very slowly in a wild
place like this, and it may be years before it bears
any at all. In the meanwhile, tell your brothers
what I have been telling you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella promised and then proceeded to the one
thing more she had to say. It was a request on
Archie’s behalf,—a petition that he might amuse
himself as he pleased upon the Storr, a high rock,
formed like a pyramid, that stood out from one
point in the bay in which Ella’s cottage stood.
This rock was an island at high water, being
joined to Garveloch only by a strip of sand,
which was overflowed twice every day. Myriads
of sea-birds haunted this rock; and Archie having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.30'>30</span>once found his way to these, his favourite
companions, could not, his sister believed, be
kept from going continually. The laird gave
ready permission, only offering a caution against
the perils of the tide, rising and falling as it
did perpetually in the very path. Of this, Ella
had no fear; for not the most skilful seamen
could be more cautious, or appear more knowing
than Archie, when he had to do with the tide. His
sister observed that he had never put life or limb
in the way of peril; and this caution so peculiar to
children in Archie’s state, went far to confirm the
island superstition that the poor boy was under
special invisible protection, and therefore screened
from ill usage at the hand of man, as well as
from natural perils.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Storr being yielded to Archie as freely as
the rocks to Ronald and the peat-moss to Fergus,
Ella’s business was done, and her gratitude secured,—gratitude
offered as soon as deserved,
and in greater abundance than the laird thought
the occasion required, however Mr. Callum might
complain of the absence of this prime qualification
of a tenant. Ella’s gratitude was not eloquent,
but the laird saw enough of its effects upon her
countenance and manner to wonder at the degree
of satisfaction caused by the present arrangement.
He kindly bade Ella farewell, and while she rapidly
descended the rocks by one path, he sought
his party by another.</p>

<p class='c001'>He found his companions in great consternation,
and the boatmen looking about on the beach, as if
for something which had been dropped. What were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.31'>31</span>they looking for,—a bracelet, a brooch, or was it
a watch? Ornaments and valuables should not
be trusted abroad on such expeditions.—O it was
nothing of that kind; it was the boat they were
looking for! The boat! and did they expect to
find it among the shingles, or hidden under the
sea-weeds? Who had drawn it up on the beach or
moored it in the cove? Nobody could lay claim
to the praise of such a service; the boat had been
left to itself, and had, of course, drifted down the
Sound with the tide, and was probably dashed to
pieces. While the responsible persons were
bandying reproaches, the English gentleman began
to anticipate the fate he had been warned of,—a
pig for his pillow, and eggs in his shoes, if
indeed he could hope for the luxury of a bed, or
of liberty to put off his clothes. The laird ordered
the only measure now in their power,—to borrow
the boat in which Ella and her brothers were
about to return home. The farmer promised to
house his relations for the night, and to send
them back when his boat should return the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>After waiting more than an hour, the people
appeared at a great distance on the beach bearing
the boat, instead of on the sea, being borne by
the boat. The farmer explained that this was,
perhaps, the shorter way, as the jutting rocks
must have compelled them to make a wide
circuit.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where are the oars?” said the laird, as they
approached; whereupon they once more looked
around them, saying, they thought the oars had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.32'>32</span>been safe enough though the boat was gone. It
was not the case, however, and more messengers
were dispatched for Ella’s oars. The ladies began
to shiver and look at each other, when one of
their companions observed it would be terribly
late and very dark before they could get home.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Late, but not dark,” said the laird; “you
forget how long our twilight lasts. We shall be
able to see our way till midnight.—Come, make
haste with your stowage, my good man. But
look here! how are you to row? The pins are
out that should fix your oars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They had disappeared since morning, Fergus
said, and he could not imagine how; he and his
brother never pretended to row without, and it
was not they who had loosened the pins. It was
of more importance to supply the pins than to
find who had taken them. Farmer Murdoch sent
his boys to pull some teeth out of his wooden
harrow, and, after another hour, they were fitted
in, the boat launched with the ladies in it, and
all apparently ready at last. No sooner, however,
had the little vessel left the cove, than it was
found to be a pity that there was no sail, as the
wind seemed likely to be favourable, and might
make up for lost time. In the midst of doubt
and debate, the rowers put back, waving their
bonnets to Murdoch and his party, who were
ascending the rock.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What’s your will?” cried all on shore.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A sail! a mast!” answered all in the boat.
One went one way and another another, to find a
pole for the mast, and a broomstick for the yard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.33'>33</span>and blankets to make a sail. There was no step
for a mast, nor provision for a rudder; but no
matter! The pole was tied with twine to one of
the benches, and an oar was held at the helm,
while the blankets were pinned together with
wooden skewers, and managed by means of a
scarlet garter tied to the corner, and thus transferred
from the knee of one of the boatmen to his
hand. The preparations being completed, the progress
of the party was again watched by Ella, who
anxiously observed the length of the shadows
from the rocks upon the bay. When the boat
emerged from the shadow and was caught by the
wind, it appeared likely to be blown due north,
and the party might have been landed very wide
of their destination, if a little puff of wind had
not carried the sail overboard, and obliged the
men to take to their oars after all. It was evident,
from there being no delay, that nobody
was lost or injured, and Farmer Murdoch was,
therefore, at liberty to laugh when he saw his
blankets, with their scarlet ornaments, gently
floated down the Sound, and seeming to excite
the curiosity of the sea birds, which made a dip,
in their evening flight homewards, to look at this
new marine production.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br /> <br /> THE FIRST EXCURSION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The laird’s orders being too positive to be disobeyed,
Ella and her brothers were permitted to
enter their new dwelling by the time the herrings
began to appear from the deep seas to the north.
As Ella was anxious to be preparing her resources
against the rent day, she watched the
first signs of the approach of the fish, determining
to try the experiment of selling them
fresh to the people at the other end of her island,
who, having no boats, could not fish for themselves.
Ronald was going out to his usual
labour in the field one July morning, when he
observed Ella looking first up to the sky and
then abroad over the glittering Sound in which
the islands lay, like vessels becalmed, and beyond
which arose the blue peaks of Argyleshire.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The sun is bright over Lorn, Ella; were ye
thinking of a trip to-day?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed I was,—not with the nets,—time
enough for that; but we might try with the
hook and see if the shoals are near; but if the
sun will not keep out, we shall only lose our
day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is Archie going to do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Archie, my man,” said his sister, “will ye
bring me some eggs this day? See, the fowl
are waiting for ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We’ll wait a bit,” said Ella to her brother:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.35'>35</span>“if he does not come back in half an hour, we
may trust to the sun not to cheat us.” So Ronald
looked out the rods and hooks, while his sister
bustled about the cottage before she girded herself
for the oar. While thus employed, she sang
in the raised voice with which maidens sing in
these islands. Ere long, she turned round and
saw Archie sitting at the door-sill fastening a
piece of string to a switch, in imitation of the
rods Ronald was preparing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Archie; have you quarrelled with the
birds to-day, that ye are home so soon? And
where are my eggs?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fowl must wait,” muttered Archie. “I
can’t play to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are ye ill, my lad?” enquired his sister,
tenderly passing her hand over his forehead:
but Archie withdrew himself and began switching
himself with his new rod.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye may go to the field, Ronald; I’m not
for the sea to-day,” said Ella. And in less than
an hour the sky was overcast, and summer
storms swept over the Sound at intervals till
night.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We may always trust Archie,” observed
Ronald. “He has a keener sight into the place
of storms than we.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The next day the birds did not wait in vain for
Archie. He was stirring as soon as they, having
stolen out from his sister’s side at dawn, and
crossed the bar of sand while the tide was yet
low. When the sun peeped above the mountains
of Lorn, as fair as on the preceding day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.36'>36</span>the little lad shouted and clapped his hands above
his head; whereupon myriads of sea-birds rose
fluttering round him, and wheeled, and dipped,
and hovered with cries that would have dismayed
a stranger, but which Archie always
gloried in provoking. While they drove round
his head like autumn leaves in a storm, the terns
and gulls screaming, the auks piping, and the
cormorants croaking, the boy answered them
with shouts and waved his bonnet over his head.
Then he clambered to the highest point he could
reach that he might watch the long files of
solan geese, as they took their morning flight
southwards, and be sure that they were out of
sight before he filled his bonnet with their eggs.</p>

<p class='c001'>His sister and Ronald observed him when they
had pushed off from the beach, and were winning
their way, each with a steady oar, to the
deep waters beyond the bay.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fare ye well, Archie,” shouted Ronald in a
voice which made the rocks ring again; but
Archie took no notice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is too busy to mind. See how he peeps
over yon ledge that neither you nor I dare
climb. I wager he finds a prize there: he’s
dancing with pleasure. He has taken them all,
and down he creeps,—aye, take care, my lad:
that’s it; now on his knees, and there finding a
step with his foot. Ye see he never slips. Now
he’s down, I’ll try to win a look.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella sang with all the power of her lungs, and
this time Archie turned, clapped his hands and
stood still to watch the boat.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.37'>37</span>“He will not be home sooner than we,” said
Ronald. “He is happy to-day, and he will
wait for the afternoon ebb.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have put some more bannocks in his hole,”
said Ella, “and some fresh water, so he will
want for nothing till night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the storm cast up so much weed yesterday,”
said Ronald, “that he may float all the
day, if he likes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This floating was Archie’s favourite amusement,
in the interval between the departure of
the gannets in the morning and their return
from the south at eve. There was a strong
current round the Storr, from an eddy below the
hole he called his cave quite round the point to a
ledge of rocks on the other side of the promontory;
which ledge being a favourable spot for
embarkation, was called the quay. Archie’s
delight was to drop feathers, straws, weed, or
eggshells, into the eddy, to watch them come up
again after they had disappeared, and float round
the point, and to find them again collected at
the quay. Nobody could please him so well as
by giving him a new substance to float; and he
brought home many a gannet for the sake of the
feathers, more than for the kind smile and stroke
of the head with which Ella rewarded such
enterprises. She was proud of Archie’s feats in
bird-catching; and if ever she spoke to a
stranger on her domestic affairs, represented
Archie as adding to the resources of the household,
in no small degree. He seldom exerted
himself to hunt the puffins out of their burrows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.38'>38</span>in the rock, and had not sense or patience to
manage snares; but such birds as were stupid
enough to go on laying their eggs where they
were taken away as soon as they appeared, and
such as were tame enough to sit still and be
taken by the hand, were Archie’s prey. He
twisted their necks as he had seen his brothers
do, and pouched them in his plaid, and still
conceived himself to be on terms of close friendship
with the species, fancying that their morning
screams were cries of invitation to him, and
returning the compliment at eve, by singing
southwards from the highest point he could
reach, if he thought them late in coming home.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was not mistaken in thinking the herrings
were come. There were so many stragglers
ready to be caught with newly-tinned hooks, that
it was evident a shoal was at hand, and that
her nets might be brought into use within a few
days.</p>

<p class='c001'>“See there!” said Ella, when late in the afternoon
she and her brother suspended their labour
to eat and rest; “it brightens one’s eyes to see
such a spoil for one day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And such fine fish too,” replied Ronald.
“My heart misgave me this morning lest we
should find them like what they were last year.
It would be a good thing for such as we if we
could judge of herring like cod, and know when
we should find them well-fed and most fit to be
eaten. Last year they were as lean as a moor,
and now they are as plump as a barley-field.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thanks be to Him that guides them in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.39'>39</span>deep waters,” said Ella; “there will be joy
under many a roof this season.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald reverently uncovered his head. “I
wonder,” said he, “that we see no more boats.
Yon sloop is from Greenock, I wager; come to
take up herrings and kelp. She may keep her
anchor down long; for not a hook has been
thrown in the Sound till ours, that I could see,
and yonder is the first kelp fire within sight this
season.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ll have one of your own, next season,
Ronald, and, I doubt not, it will show light betimes.
So willing as ye are to help in the field
and on the water, we owe ye our toil when the
storms come. The field once laid out, and the
profits of the fish safe pouched, and Fergus’s
peat stored, he and I will be your servants in
our turn, Ronald, and cut and cull weed as fast
as ye can draw it in. The rope is begun
already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it? How thoughtful ye are, Ella! When
could ye find time to think of my rope?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, there’s ever time for what ought to be
provided. I have thinned the pony’s tail now
and then for a long time, so that I have near
hair enough; and when Archie was heavy one
day, I thought I could work for you and sing to
him at one time; and in the storm yesterday
I twisted more. We shall have a long
stout rope before the first large drift of weed,
and if ye crop the ledges as plentifully as they
promise, we shall have a grand fire, one of the
first of the season. How proud it will make me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.40'>40</span>Ronald, to help to row over your first venture of
kelp!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not so proud as it will make me to put the
money into the pouch, Ella. To think that I
help to pay the laird!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish it might be into his own hands,” said
Ella. “I should like to make you the bearer of
it then.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if not,” said Ronald, “it will be
honour enough to discharge ourselves of Mr.
Callum. Ye have taught me my lesson there,
Ella; and when the time comes, I’ll show ye a
picture of yourself as like as a lad can be to a
tall woman. I’ll go out beside the door when I
hear the pace of his pony on the shingle, and
fold my arms in my plaid, and make a reverence
about half as low as to the laird, only stiffer.
And I’ll show the lap of the pouch and say,
Here are the laird’s dues. Would it please
you to count them now or when we have pledged
your head and ours?’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’re a saucy lad,” said Ella: “you know
he can’t bear to hear that any one is head over
him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the very reason everybody puts him
in mind of it,” replied Ronald. “Well; all
this time Fergus is holding his pony, and you
are spreading the best cloth, and he is looking
doubtful whether he shall come in, not liking the
coldness of people so far below him, but smelling
the hot goose very savoury.—So he comes in to
count the dues at any rate, after which—”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, Ronald, hold your tongue, or we shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.41'>41</span>have no dues to count. I’ve done my meal, and
see where we have drifted, and the sun going
down too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella plied both oars, while Ronald hastily
devoured the rest of his bannock. When they
got within easy reach of home, they once more
drew in their oars and cast their hooks; but as
it was with less success than before, Ronald
again gave a loose to his tongue, in a way which
his awe of his sister would not have allowed if
Fergus had not been absent, and if his being
Ella’s sole partner in an excursion of business
had not established an unusual familiarity between
them. After providing that Fergus should
have his turn as rent-payer, he went on—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should like to make Archie do it for once.
Do you think we could teach him his lesson?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will not have him tried,” said Ella decidedly.
“Archie is not made to hold a money-pouch,
nor to have any worldly dealings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet he brings in what helps to fill it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how innocently! It is his love for the
things that God made that makes him follow
sport. The birds are his playmates while they
wheel round his head, and when he takes them on
the nest, he has no thought of gain,—and evil
be to him that first puts the thought into him!
He strokes their soft feathers against his cheek,
and watches the white specks wandering through
the water like snow-flakes through the air. He
does not look beyond the pleasure to his eyes
and to his heart, and he never shall; and gold
and silver are not the things to give pleasure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.42'>42</span>such an eye and such a heart, and he shall never
know them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then he can never know how much he owes
you, Ella, for the care you take of him. He
little guesses how you have spun half the night
to make his plaid, and won money hardly to find
him a bonnet, and all the toil of your fishing,
and grinding, and baking.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And why should he? He loves me, and all
the better for not knowing why. He wears his
plaid as the birds do their feathers; he feels it
warm, and never thinks where it came from. He
finds his barley-cakes and fresh water in his cave
as lambs find clover and springs in their pasture.
I see him satisfied, and like that he should love
me for what costs me no toil,—for singing when
he is heavy, and for wearing what he brings me
when he is merry. When he lays his hot head
in my lap, or pulls my skirt to make me listen to
the wind, I value his love all the more for its not
being bought.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see you always lure him out when Mr.
Callum is coming,” observed Ronald.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and for the same reason I let him hide
himself among the rocks the day the laird was
here—I have a constant fear that Mr. Callum
would be for sending him away; and so I <a id='corr42.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hinde'>hinder</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_42.27'><ins class='correction'>hinder</ins></a></span>
our having any words about the lad. I am
easier about that since the laird himself took
notice of him so kindly: but Mr. Callum shall
never lay a finger on his head, even to bless him,
if I can help it. Better keep him innocent of
the man entirely.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.43'>43</span>“He is likely to be innocent of all but ourselves,
and now and then the Murdochs; for he
sees nobody else.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He has more companions than we have, too.
He makes friendship where we only make war
among living things. How he would handle
these very fish that we stow away so carelessly!
But come; we have caught the last we shall get
to-day: let us make haste home and to rest. I
must be stirring early and away to make the first
winnings for the pouch, and Fergus shall have
his turn with me to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was determined to try for once whether
she could not make her way by land to the
north of the island. There was no road, and the
difficulty of some of the passes was so great as
to render the journey as fatiguing as one of
twenty miles. In a strait line, it would not have
been so much as two miles; but the many and
steep ascents trebled the actual distance, while
some were nearly if not quite impassable. If she
could once, with her pony, traverse the island,
she might be able to judge whether it would
afford any market for her fresh fish; and at the
same time learn whether there were fertile spots
to which her brothers might drive their cattle,
and whether it would answer to load their pony
with weed for manure or kelp from different
parts of the shore.</p>

<p class='c001'>It proved a toilsome experiment. She sold
some of her fish at her own price; but there
were so few families, and they could so seldom
afford to buy food, that it seemed hardly likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.44'>44</span>to answer to give up a whole day of her own
labour and the pony’s for so poor a return, in
addition to the previous day’s labour in fishing.
They found some patches of good grass among
the dells, but too difficult of access to be of
much use; and their examination of the shore
convinced them that Ronald had possession of
the best portion within the circuit of the island.—All
this settled, the next object was to prepare
for a trip to the Greenock sloop.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span><br /> <br /> WHOM HAVE WE HERE?</h3>

<p class='c015'>Ronald had an opportunity of being dignified
towards Mr. Callum long before the rent-day
came round. The steward’s curiosity led him
to visit the tenants and see how they were
attempting to improve their croft; and one day
in October his boat was seen rounding the Storr,
and making for the landing-place. Archie
happened to be amusing himself on his island
at the time, and Mr. Callum was observed by
Ella to turn round as if watching the boy’s proceedings
up to the moment of landing. He
looked by no means in his pleasantest mood.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good morning,” said he, as Ella awaited
him at the door of the cottage. “Where are
your brothers? I want your brothers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ronald is in the field. I will call him, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.45'>45</span>you will please to sit down. He will not detain
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let him alone, pray. The other lads will do
as well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fergus is gone a trip to-day to sell his peat;
we do not expect him till night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To sell his peat! He had better take care
of his own supply first, I think. You will want
to use all you can get before the winter is over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella replied by opening a boarded window on
one side of the cottage, through which was seen,
at a little distance, a large well-built stack of peat.
She next added some to her fire, that Mr. Callum
might not have to complain that she grudged fuel
in her hospitality.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And pray how does Fergus manage to get
peat enough for everybody? He keeps within
his boundary, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was too much offended to answer otherwise
than by pointing the way to the peat-land,
where, however, the steward showed no inclination
to go.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would have him take care what he is about,”
continued Callum. “I have the laird’s strict
orders that the live turf is to be replaced over
every inch from which peat is dug.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella observed that it was for Fergus’s interest
to observe this rule on a land which he hoped to
hold for a long time, since the peat could not
otherwise be renewed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No need to tell me that, Ella; but these
youngsters are in such a hurry to cut, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.46'>46</span>when they can sell, that they forget the law.
Remember, if I find a foot bare, the peat-land is
forfeited.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your threat is harsh, sir, and if you should
act upon it, I should be obliged to appeal to the
laird; but let us see whether Fergus has put
himself in your power.” And she moved on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is all this?” cried the irritable steward,
as they walked up the little sloping beach towards
the back of the tenement. “Your brothers get
the fairies to help them, I think. Who ever saw
barley growing out of a round shingle,—clean
shingle without any soil?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My father saw it, as he used to tell us, in
rocky places where soil was scarce; and when we
found we could do little with our field this season,
Ronald bethought himself of this plan; and
it answers very well, you see. We laid down sea-weed
pretty thick, and dropped our seed into it,
and now the manure is changed into food for us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor grain enough,” said Callum.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not so good as we hope to raise in our field,
but good enough to be acceptable to those who
would otherwise have none.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And pray how long do you mean to let it
stand? The wind will soon make it shed its
grain, and then much good, may the straw do
you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella observed that it had been late sown, so
that they were glad to let it stand to the last
moment. The autumn was particularly serene
and warm, so that the grain was still uninjured;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.47'>47</span>but it was to be cut the next day but one, when
she should have sold her fish and made room for
her humble harvest.—What fish? and where
was she going to sell it?—She had salted a cask
of herrings, and was about to make a trip to the
sloop from Glasgow now in the Sound to dispose
of the produce of her fishing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Callum muttered something about their taking
good care of themselves; and the too great kindness
of the laird not to ask rent for all they held.
It should be done soon, he could promise them.—Whenever
they had a neighbour who should
follow the same occupations, Ella quietly observed,
they should be willing to pay rent for the
field, and the waters, and the peat-ground, and
the kelping-shore.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And why not sooner, if I chose to ask it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because it would answer better to us to
move to some place in equal condition, where no
rent would be asked.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And where will you find such an one, my
lass?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella mounted the rock near, and pointed to one
island and another and another where situations
as good as this had not yet been taken possession
of, and which the laird would be glad to see improved,
provided he received the interest of the
capital he laid out. Callum observed that she
seemed to think herself very knowing, and asked
where she got all this wisdom. When he found
that the matter had been talked over and settled
with the laird himself, he had nothing more to say
on that subject.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.48'>48</span>He was not more fortunate on the next topic.
He asked who it was on the Storr that was
screaming like a sea-gull, and throwing his arms
about as if he was going to fly across the Sound?
Ella paused a moment before she replied that it
was her brother Archibald; and then underwent
a cross-questioning about the lad, and the reasons
why he had not been introduced with the rest
into Mr. Callum’s august presence. An obvious
mode of venting his spleen now presented itself.
He insisted upon what Ella did not attempt to
deny, that the Storr did not come within her
boundaries, and followed this up by a prohibition
to every one of the family to set foot on the rock.
Ella was now truly glad that she had obtained the
laird’s special permission for Archie to haunt the
rock as much as he pleased. Mr. Callum’s
temper was not improved by learning the fact.
He did not pretend to doubt it; for, in the first
place, he knew Ella to be remarkable for strict
honour; and, in the next, she seemed so guarded
on all points, that he began to think it prudent
not to expose his authority to more mortifications.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald now appeared, ready to show Mr.
Callum what had been done in his department,
as well as in Fergus’s. Ella cautioned her brother
by a look which he well understood, to keep
his temper and restrain his tongue, and then returned
to her occupations in the cottage. Callum
resumed the subject of Archie, but could
make little out of Ronald about him; for, besides
that the tender respect in which they held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.49'>49</span>the poor lad made them unwilling to speak of
his peculiarities to strangers, Ronald knew his
sister’s desire to keep Archie out of Callum’s
notice. He was now rather more discreet than
was necessary, and left an impression on the
steward’s mind that there was some mystery
about the boy,—a mystery which must be penetrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>He did not accept Ella’s proffered hospitality,
having already ordered his dinner at the farm;
but he sauntered down again in the evening to
see Fergus come home, and hear whether he
had made a good bargain of his peat. A fit of
superstition about the fairies came upon him
again when he heard that not only was the present
cargo sold among the inhabitants of a sandy
island near, but so much more was wanted, that
Ronald must borrow Murdoch’s boat, the first
convenient day, and accompany Fergus in
their own in another trip to the same market.
Callum laughed when Fergus said he had taken
no money, his customers not being possessed of
any coin; but he brought oatmeal, salt, and a
light basket, or rather pouch, made of birch
twigs and oatstraw, for Archie to carry eggs in.
He was offered oil, but thought they had obtained
enough from their fish to last the season.
Ella approved his bargain, and said that oatmeal
and salt, being both wanted, were more to her
than money just now, and would save her a
voyage. So Fergus was happy, and nothing
remained to be wished but that Mr. Callum
would go away. He paced the little beach as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.50'>50</span>he was waiting for something, and at last asked
impatiently when the younger lad would come
home.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When the tide is low enough for him to
cross; maybe in two hours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was too long for a cross person’s patience;
so the steward departed without seeing
Archie this time.</p>

<p class='c001'>The morrow was to be a busy day,—the day
of the first sale of salted herrings. As the cask
was to be carried on board the sloop, Ella wished
her brothers to go with her. She wanted their
help, and also desired that they should gain such
experience in that kind of traffic as would fit
them for going without her on a future occasion:
for she did not much like the idea of boarding
the vessel and making her bargain among the
sailors.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lads embarked their cask, fitted, for the
first time, the wooden key to the wooden lock of
their door, carried Archie high and dry through
the surf, and deposited him, laughing, beside
his sister, and pulled stoutly round the point in
the teeth of a strong and chilling wind. Archie
was in one of his merry moods this day, which
made his sister the less unwilling to leave him
with the Murdochs at the farm till evening,
which she was about to do. He laughed when
the wind drove the spray in their faces, and mimicked
the creaking of the oars in their sockets
as they strained against the force of a rough sea.
He made some resistance to being landed when
they reached the cove below the farm, but took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.51'>51</span>his sister’s hand and ascended the cliff with her
while repeating that he wanted to go on the sea
again.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Murdochs were good-natured people,
when nothing happened to make them otherwise,
and they declared themselves delighted to see
Archie, and promised to take all possible care of
him. Ella reminded them that the only care
necessary was to give him his dinner, and see
that he did not stray beyond the farm.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the rowers got fairly out to sea, they
were dismayed to find that the sloop had disappeared
during the night. There was every reason
to fear that they were a day too late for the
market, and that the last vessel to be seen that
season was now sailing away from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If it be,” said Ronald, “we must take a
voyage to the Clyde islands, or perhaps to
Greenock; and I should not much mind that:
Ella could do without us for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We must prevent such a waste of time,”
said Ella; “so pull away southwards, and let us
see if we cannot overtake the sloop. She cannot
have gone far with this wind. The first of you
that wearies, give me the oar.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The boys continued their rowing in silence
till Ella desired Ronald to make for a boat some
way off and hail it. He did so.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Holla! Which way lies the Jean Campbell?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gone northwards before the wind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Northwards! Then she could not have completed
her cargo yet; “but would she return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.52'>52</span>through the same Sounds?” they asked the people
in the other boat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hardly likely,” was the answer; “but there
is another coming up, the Mary of Port Glasgow.
If ye clear the point, ye’ll see her with all
her sails set, unless she has stopped to take in
kelp or herrings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Away went the boat again, and eager were
the rowers to learn whether the market was yet
open to them. In half an hour they came in
sight of the Mary, not sailing before the wind
as they expected; but rolling idly on the rough
sea, while boats were making towards her from
various points of the shores within sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>When they came alongside, Ella spoke her
errand; and on receiving an encouraging answer,
would willingly have sent her brothers on board
to manage their bargain, while she remained in
the boat. But it was too important an affair for
them to conduct, inexperienced as they were in
traffic; and it was necessary for her to go on
deck of the Mary. While talking with the master,
and observing no one else, she did not perceive,
as Ronald did, that a man on deck who
looked like a passenger, was watching her closely,
and drawing nearer to listen to what she said.
Ronald placed himself beside his sister, and then
the stranger looked down into the boat where
Fergus remained.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you make room for me, Fergus?” he
asked. “Will you take me home with you to
see your father and Archie?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fergus reddened all over; and when he made
his reply, the stranger was moved also.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.53'>53</span>“Your father dead!” he exclaimed. “I
never heard it. Let me come to you that you
may tell me all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must ask Ella if there’s room for you,”
said Fergus; “besides, I don’t know who you
are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you ever think of one Angus that you
once knew?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, often enough, and wonder if he be
dead. Why, I do believe you are Angus, sir!
Ronald, Ronald! See if this be not Angus back
again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was Angus; but so changed, that it was no
wonder his younger friends did not know him
after five years of absence. Ella knew him at a
glance, when the sound of his name made her
turn her head. She looked steadily in his face,
and asked, with a calm voice, what brought him
among the islands again?—but her cheek was
pale as ashes, and her hands trembled so that
she could hardly hold the money which the impatient
master was in a hurry to pay her. Angus,
as agitated as herself, made no reply to her question,
but leapt into her boat in order to assist
her down. She drew back immediately.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ella! you will let me go home with you.
We must not part almost before we have met.
I am bound for Garveloch, and you must let me
row you home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not know our present home, Angus.
If you choose to seek us there, you will find a
welcome; but I cannot take you.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.54'>54</span>Angus now grew pale. He turned quickly
round upon Fergus,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is Ella married?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With a light step he sprang back into the
Mary, whispering to Ella as he handed her down,</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have much to say, and am eager to say it.
For whatever reasons you refuse to let me go
with you, you cannot prevent my following.
Farewell now. You will soon see me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella turned back as she was departing to tell
him that she had removed, and to describe where
she might be found. Encouraged by this circumstance,
Angus smiled, and Ella’s stern countenance
relaxed.—Never had she frowned as
Angus did when he heard the seamen jesting on
the fishwoman who carried herself as high as a
princess to the master. “It is not the way of
fishwomen,” quoth they, “even when they bring
half a cargo, instead of one poor cask like that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus thought to himself that she was a princess,—the
princess of fishwomen. He knew her
well,—all her thoughts and all her feelings, in
former days, and he saw already that she had
lost none of her dignity under the pressure of
her cares. He presently arranged with the master
to meet the Mary at a certain point among
the islands, within a few days, for the purpose of
removing his luggage; and obtained a seat in a
boat whose crew engaged to set him on shore in
Garveloch.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_2.55'>55</span>
  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span><br /> <br /> A HIGHLAND NIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Scarcely a word was spoken in Ella’s boat during
the return. Her brothers began to revive
their recollections of Angus, of what he had
taught them, and how he played with them,
and of whatever he said and did; but observing
that Ella, instead of joining in their conversation,
drew her plaid over her head and fixed her eyes
on the waters, they kept a respectful silence, and
even refrained from asking a single question on
the important subject of her traffic with the master
of the Mary. The wind still rose and increased
the difficulty of rowing so much, that the
lads would soon have been disposed to leave off
talking, if no restraint had been upon them. At
last, Ella observed poor Fergus wiping his brows,
though the gale was chill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fergus, give me the oar. I have been very
thoughtless,—or, rather, over full of thought,—or
you should not have toiled for me all this time.
Take my plaid, for this breeze is wintry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She threw her plaid round him and gave him
a slight caress as she passed to take his place.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sing, Fergus,” said his brother, “it lightens
the way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as he had recovered his breath, Fergus
sang an air which Angus used to love to
time for them with his oar where he took them
out to sea for pleasure, before their days of toil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.56'>56</span>began. Ella joined her voice, perhaps for the
purpose of checking the tears which began to
flow faster than at any time since the night of
her parent’s death. Apparently unconscious of
them, she plied her toil and her song more
vigorously when the boat neared the cove where
they were to take in Archie. They looked out
for him, hoping that the song might bring him
down to the boat and prevent any loss of time in
getting home. Nobody appeared, however, but
one of Murdoch’s girls, standing stock still on
the ridge of the rock. Ella signed and beckoned,
and her brothers shouted for Archie; to all which
the lass made no other answer than shaking her
head like a weathercock.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Give me my plaid,” said Ella, who instantly
stepped on shore and mounted to the farm. She
could see nobody for some time, and when she
did, it was only the girl who had watched her
landing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where are all the family, Meg?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All gone, except Archie; he’s back again.
Father and others are gone to the moor for
peat, and mother is milking the cows a great
way off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And Archie? Call him, for we must be
going.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He can’t get out,” said Meg, grinning, and
pointing to Mr. Callum’s apartment, the shutters
of which were closed. “He’s all in the dark,
and he has been flogged for stealing the laird’s
birds, and I don’t know how many eggs and
feathers.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.57'>57</span>Ella had scarcely patience to stand and hear
the story. Archie, being left to himself, had
wandered home and gained his rock. Callum
had watched and followed him, and caught the
poor boy with a solan goose in his bosom, eggs
in his new basket, and a bunch of feathers in his
cap. The steward had flogged Archie unmercifully
with his cane, partly unaware, it must be
hoped, of the true state of the case, since he had
told the sufferer that his discipline was meant to
teach him not to take what did not belong to
him. He brought him back, closed the shutters
of his apartment, pushed the boy in, and double-locked
the door, telling the children who looked
on in terror that they should be served in like
manner if they attempted to speak to Archie till
he should be released. He had now been shut up
three hours, and Mr. Callum was not to be back
till night. Ella shuddered when she heard that
the boy had looked much flushed when he went
in, and had screamed violently till, nobody taking
notice, his cry had gradually sunk to a low
moaning. She rushed to the door and called
him in her gentlest voice. No answer. She sang
as she was wont to do when he was ill; and then
the moan was heard again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will die unless I can get to him. I
know that sound well. Run, Meg, and tell your
father Archie will die, if we do not break the
door that I may nurse him. Run for your life!—Hush!
Archie, hush! I am coming, lad, and
we will let in the light again, and you shall see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.58'>58</span>how the sea is tossing. I am coming, Archie;
be patient, lad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She flew to the cliff to beckon her brothers.
In a few minutes, almost everybody came but
the one most wanted, Mr. Callum. Everybody
was very sorry of course: none more so than
those who ought to have prevented this mischief.
They were willing to do anything,—to break
door or window as soon as desired. But no
proper tools were at hand, and the noise terrified
Archie so extremely, that it was thought best to
let things remain as they were till Callum’s
return, which could not be much longer delayed.
Ella sent her brothers home directly, afraid that
she should not be able to keep their tempers
within bounds when the enemy should present
himself. She waited, pacing up and down the
steep rocky path which overlooked her own
dwelling, as well as the way by which the steward
was expected to approach.</p>

<p class='c001'>After a while, she distinctly saw her brothers
standing in conversation with a third person,
beside the gate of the field. Supposing the
stranger to be Callum, she watched with the
utmost anxiety, expecting each moment to see
the lads show some sign of wrath; but their gestures
were not those of anger, nor did their companion,
on a closer examination, look like the
steward. At this instant a voice close behind
her made her start.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So you are come at last, Mr. Callum,” said
she. “I hope it may be in time to prevent your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.59'>59</span>committing murder. How do you propose to
comfort us if you find Archibald dead?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dead! Pooh, nonsense! let me tell you,
madam, I came down just in time to prevent
theft this morning. If the laird is pleased to let
idle boys play on his estate, he gives no leave for
them to steal the produce. I have not done with
master Archibald yet; I mean to make a further
example of him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ll be too late,” replied Ella, with a convulsed
countenance. “One on whom God himself
has put the mark of innocence, one that has
been ever under the guidance of good powers,—one
that has only been kept here so long by being
cherished, and no ill being suffered to come nigh
him—is not one to live under your hands, Mr.
Callum; and knowing this, I kept him out of
your sight, till an evil day has laid him open to
blame and punishment. Come, sir, and see if
your work is not done; and if not, beware how
you finish it!”</p>

<p class='c001'>So saying, she strode onwards and beckoned
him after her; but he stood still. Callum shared
largely in the superstitions which abound in the
islands, where the strongest and proudest minds
are subdued by fears too absurd to affect children
in more enlightened places. Connecting in a
moment Archie’s peculiarities, which he had been
unable to understand, Ella’s hints of his being
the favourite of unseen powers, and all that was
extraordinary in herself as she stood with flashing
eyes, and a working countenance, and her
tall form trembling with some other passion than
fear, Callum resolved to be quit of her and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.60'>60</span>boy as soon as might be; but above all things
to prevent their meeting in his presence, lest they
should work some harm upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come back, Ella,” said he, in a somewhat
softer tone; “you will only do harm by going
with me. The truth is, I have sent to the laird
for his pleasure about the lad, as there happened
to be a messenger going. I shall have an
answer by the morn, and then I will release your
brother,—if you stay out of my sight, not otherwise,
I promise you: so go your ways home,
and trust the boy with me for the night. You
well may, for he never lay in a gentleman’s
room or on a gentleman’s bed before, I’ll be
bound to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All remonstrance, all entreaty was vain to
alter Callum’s pretended purpose: so Ella had
recourse to a secret plan in her turn. She resolved
to steal up to the farm as soon as it should
be dark, and every one gone to rest, and to work
on Mr. Callum’s fears by means which she well
understood. She now asked impatiently where
the laird was. Not where she could reach him
to lodge a counter-plea, the steward answered
with a grim smile: he held that part of justice
in his own hands. Ella could learn nothing
more than she already knew,—that he must be
near, as his answer would arrive by morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>As she was going slowly down to the beach,
she met Angus. “If ye have any friendship for
us,” cried she, showing her surprise only by her
raised colour, “if ye ever valued my father’s
blessing, help us now;” and she related what had
just passed. Angus instantly replied that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.61'>61</span>laird was at Oban. If so, Ella said, the messenger’s
boat ought to be in sight; and she looked
intently over the troubled expanse of waters, now
heaving and tossing in an autumn gale as if they
would swallow up the scattered islands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“One might easily miss a small bark in
such a sea,” said she, “and the gloom is settling
fast. See how the mists are gathering about the
Storr! The osprey will scarce find his nest, or
the bark keep clear of shoals.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There he is!” cried Angus. “Just below,
yonder, a boat shot out from behind the rock,
and now she is labouring with the swell. She
has only two rowers. Your brothers shall go
with me, and we will reach the laird first.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Go, and my blessing on you,” said Ella.
“Bring back justice and a word of kindness for
Archie, and I will thank you for ever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No time was lost; and in a few minutes the
two boats were seen rowing as close a race as
ever had honour or profit for its object. Ella
could not help wondering whether the steward
was watching the struggle with all the anxiety
that he deserved to feel, and all the shame of
being discovered in a falsehood. It was impossible
that an answer should return from Oban
before the morning, and Callum’s having said so
was a new proof that he was frightened at what
he had done.—The daylight was now failing fast:
the Argyleshire mountains lost the red tinge which
had been cast upon them from the western sky.
All was gray and misty, and when Ella fancied
for a moment that her brothers’ boat had given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.62'>62</span>up the race and changed its course, she supposed
that her overstrained sight had deceived her,
and retired slowly homewards to await the hour
when she might make another attempt upon the
farm.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a dreary night. The wind swept past
in gusts, and hail pattered in hasty showers upon
her shingled roof, as she sat beside her peat-fire,
striving to compose her busy thoughts. She
could settle to no employment, but looked out
frequently to see if she could discover the moon’s
place in the sky, in order to form some idea of
the time. At length, believing it was near midnight,
she equipped herself for her expedition,
strapping her plaid close about her, and carrying
warm clothing for the boy. While doing this,
she fancied she heard a footstep without. She
paused, but supposed it could only be the rattling
of the shingle as the waves retreated; but, not
being perfectly convinced, she looked about cautiously
through the darkness as she went forth,
and listened intently. Before she had gone many
paces, a sudden gleam of moonlight showed her
the shadow of a man, standing up against the
side wall of the cottage. She quickly retreated,
but not through fear. She lighted a slip of pinewood
and without ceremony held it up in the
man’s face. It was Callum.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are come to tell me that Archie is dead,”
said Ella, with forced calmness. “No wonder
you linger by the way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is not dead nor likely to die if, as you
say, the good powers are fond of him. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.63'>63</span>left him with them, for he is past my management.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have carried him to the sands to be
drowned,” cried Ella, snatching hold of his cloak
which was dripping wet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was more likely I should be drowned than
he,” said Callum, sullenly. “He scrambled over
to the rock as if he saw the fairies waiting for
him, and I found my way back as I could, but
the water was up to my knees.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How long since?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not above five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is time yet,” cried Ella, hastening in
for food and a bottle of milk. While she was
making her rapid preparations, Callum, who had
followed her, proceeded with his explanations
that, as he could do nothing with the boy, who
would neither eat, speak, nor sleep, he thought
it best to carry him back to his haunt and let
those manage him that could; and he hoped it
would be the last he should have to do with
people of her sort. A half-smile passed over
Ella’s countenance; she made no reply, but
pushed a seat beside the fire, set some barley-cakes
and whisky on the table, pointed to the
heap of fuel in the corner, and was gone, drawing
the door after her. Callum had feeling
enough to be stung with the reproach implied in
these observances of hospitality. He pushed the
food and drink from him and sat, with his hands
upon his knees, muttering beside the fire. A
thought struck him, he started up and ran after
Ella, shouting,</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.64'>64</span>“Let me hold the torch, lass, while you cross,
and may be I can get over too and help to bring
him home.” But Ella, who had already reached
the low sand, waved him back contemptuously,
and was half through the water before he arrived
on the brink. Dashing, foaming, the tide did
not look very tempting; and having seen Ella
climb the opposite ledge, wring out her wet plaid
and stride on, Callum returned, full of mortification,
to the fireside.</p>

<p class='c001'>The torch blew out before Ella reached
Archie’s hole. As soon as she came within hearing,
she tried to attract his attention by the usual
methods, but obtaining no answer, began to fear
that he had been placed in some other recess of
the Storr. She groped her way in, however,
and stumbled over him near the entrance. He
shrieked as she had never heard him shriek
before, and a fierce pang of indignation shot
through her heart at him who had first made this
innocent being subject to fear. She succeeded
in soothing the boy; she lavished on him all
the tender words that came with her tears; she
cooled his hot forehead; persuaded him to eat,
and hoping to make him forget where he was,
and that anything painful had passed, she told
him tales till he fell asleep with his arms round
her neck. She had soothed herself in soothing
him, and was too well inured to cold and wet to
be much affected by them; so that she too leaned
against the wall of the little cave and slept.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was some hours after, but while the dawn
was yet very faint, that Archie roused her by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.65'>65</span>starting up and running to the mouth of the cave.
A red light flickered upon his face as he stood;
and his sister following, saw a kelp fire flaming
high upon the beach. The season for kelp burning
was considered over; but a glance at the
boat drawn up on the shingle and at the figures
about the fire showed her what it meant. Her
brothers were already home, and finding the cottage
empty, and not knowing in what direction
she was gone, had lighted this fire as the best
signal which could intimate their return without
alarming Mr. Callum, to whom a kelp fire was
one of the commonest of all sights.</p>

<p class='c001'>“See, Archie, there is Ronald feeding the fire,
and Fergus stirring it. They have made the fire
to light us home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Archie did not clap his hands as usual at
the sight of a kelp fire, and seemed disposed to
hide himself in the cave. It was because a third
figure stood between them and the light. It was
the first time he had feared a stranger; and again
Ella had to battle with her mingled compassion
and indignation. She tried the experiment whether
Archie had any recollection of Angus, of
whom he had been very fond five years before.
She tempted him to a baby game which Angus
used to play with him, but which had been laid
aside as Archie grew taller. “Ah! Angus,
Angus, I want Angus!” cried the boy, just as
he used to do, and just as she wished to hear him,
for the first time since Angus’s departure.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you want Angus? Well, there he is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.66'>66</span>standing beside Fergus. Call him and perhaps
he will hear you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Poor Archie tried, but he was too much exhausted
to make himself heard to any distance;
nor did Ella succeed better, as the wind was
against her. For a full hour, she saw the three
figures pace the beach, and look intently in all
directions before they perceived her; but at last
the fluttering of her plaid became visible to them
through the grey dawn, and they ran down to
the brink of the water, which was still too deep
to be crossed on foot, though too shallow for a
boat. They waved their caps in token of having
succeeded in their errand, and awaited in the
utmost impatience the sinking of the water.
When the first patch of sand was left dry, Angus
plunged through, and, well knowing Ella’s heart,
gave his first attention to Archie. Ella gave him
his cue: he hid his face with his bonnet, let
Archie uncover it, as in old days, and was immediately
known. Archie’s loud laugh was like
music to his sister’s anxious heart. He put his
arm lovingly round the neck of his old play-fellow,
in order to his being carried home; and
though feverish and evidently in pain, showed no
greater signs of dulness and depression than on
some former occasions of illness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald was impatient to tell his sister that
they had found the laird by Angus having discerned
his boat off one of the islands, half way
between Garveloch and the shore. Callum’s
messenger, proceeding to Oban, had overshot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.67'>67</span>his mark, and missed giving the first version of
the tale which both parties were in haste to tell.
The laird had pronounced no judgment, but
would probably land on Garveloch, in a day or
two, and hear both sides of the question.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then,” said Ella, “thanks to your zeal, our
point is gained.”</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span><br /> <br /> THE SCOTCH ABROAD</h3>

<p class='c015'>Angus’s zeal had indeed been equal to that of
the brothers; in addition to which his patience
had been most meritorious. He waited till
Archie was safe before he said a word of his
errand to Garveloch or made any reference to his
former friendship with Ella and her family. His
turn to be cared for came at last. Ella recovered
her courtesy when the little party was seated at
the morning meal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Welcome to our board, Angus,” said she.
“You will excuse our being so late in saying the
words and offering the hand of welcome.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Far more easily,” said Angus, grasping her
offered hand in great emotion; “far more easily,
Ella, than the coldness with which you offer it at
last. If I were an utter stranger, you could not
look more haughty than you do at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, Angus; you have yourself ordered
your reception. If you have made yourself a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.68'>68</span>stranger for five long years, you cannot wonder
that we look upon you as such.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have ever explained, Ella, why I could
not come; and as it pleased you to take no
notice of my reasons, I left off offering them,
though not till after a longer perseverance than
you would have condescended to use.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Reasons! How offered? By whom brought?
When were they sent? These and many more
questions were asked in a hurry by the two lads,
while their sister waited in evident anxiety for
an answer. It appeared that Angus had written
two or three letters before he entered into the
service of the nobleman in whose suite he had
gone to America. Being there employed in the
interior, he had no longer any means of sending
to Scotland, but hoped that his former letters
had proved him trustworthy; and that when he
returned to his native country, he should be able
to obtain some intimation that he would be welcome
among his old friends. None such having
arrived, he now came in person to see whether
he was forgotten, or whether the family was dead
and dispersed like his own, or what else could
have happened. It now appeared for the first
time that Ella and her brothers knew neither that
his mother had died in Lorn, nor that he had
entered into anybody’s service, nor that he had
gone to America, or returned from abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bless me!” cried Angus. “I do believe
the fairies are in Garveloch, and Mr. Callum
in the right after all! Come, Ronald, can you
tell me who is king of England now?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.69'>69</span>Ronald looked at Fergus, and Fergus at Ella,
and Ella said she heard one of the seamen on
board the Mary swear by king George.—Aye;
but which king George? This was more than
our islanders could tell; and they reminded
Angus that till they boarded the sloop for the
first time, they had not seen a strange face for
years. The laird and Mr. Callum were their only
visitors, and politics had never been talked in
this island since the rebellion under the Pretender.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus said he could not be jealous of their
ignorance about his proceedings in Canada, if no
tidings of King George ever reached Garveloch.
He looked grave, however, when he remarked
that such complete separation from the world
was a serious disadvantage in their traffic. As
long as they knew nothing of the prices which
their herrings and kelp bore in the market, they
were completely at the mercy of those who came
to buy of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There!” cried Ronald with great delight,
“I always said we should go ourselves to
Greenock instead of selling to sloops in the
Sound.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not think so, Ronald. You would pay
more in time and trouble than the information
would be worth. If there was anybody here
who could read a newspaper——”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nobody within reach, but Mr. Callum, had
ever learned the alphabet, and they could not
take the liberty of asking him for information,
even if he came at the right time to give it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.70'>70</span>Angus observed that there would be an end of
this difficulty if, as he hoped, he should settle
in Garveloch.—In the midst of the shouts of the
lads, and the shaking of hands caused by this
hint, Angus looked down as bashfully as if he
had never crossed the Atlantic and seen the
world. He evaded all inquiries as to his plans,
and seemed anxious to go back to the past.—He
related that after being for some time in the
service of the nobleman under whom he went
out, he took office, at the particular request of his
master, under the surveyor and agents appointed
to measure and dispose of lands to new settlers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What made your master choose you for that
service?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many of the settlers were from our part of
the kingdom, and the surveyor and agents were
English. Quarrels arose out of their different
ways of thinking and managing; and some one
was wanted to mediate between them. I am
heartily glad I was chosen, for I learned a great
deal that I should never have known by other
means.—It was not utter banishment either; for
I now and then met a face I knew, and could
talk with a countryman of friends at home.
There was Forbes for one; you remember
Forbes, Ella?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! he that was suspected of pitching a
man from his boat into the sea after a quarrel?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same. He was innocent, I am convinced;
but he was so weary of having it cast
up to him, that he went abroad and settled in our
district in Canada. He had two neighbours that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.71'>71</span>I knew something of,—Keith, from Dumbarton,
and Canmore the drover. Many a time did we
look back together to the bare rocks and bleak
moors of Scotland, while we were buried in the
thickest of forests.—At those times, we used to
wish, for the sake of all parties, that we could send
you half our trees, for we were as much troubled
with having too many as you with too few.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” said Fergus, “not too few. There
are near a dozen birches on the farm above; and
one may see a good many alders in the hollows
near where we used to live.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus laughed heartily at Fergus’s idea of a
sufficiency of wood, and explained to him the
proportion of trees to an acre in a Canadian
forest.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What can they do with them?” Ronald
asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get rid of them as fast as they can; but it
costs vast labour.—Forbes, who was not driven
there by poverty, and carried money, was saved
the trouble of clearing. He took a fine fertile
piece of ground on the understanding that he
would have to pay the highest rent of anybody
in the neighbourhood. Canmore was the next
to settle; and he liking the axe little better than
Forbes, paid a sum for having his land cleared;
but as his land was not so good as Forbes’s, he
did not pay real rent for some time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did Forbes begin paying real rent?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; for there was land equally good elsewhere,
which he knew he could have for the cost
of clearing and enclosing.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.72'>72</span>“Then he paid the interest of capital laid out,
as we do for this cottage and fence, and as Canmore
did when he took possession of his land?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just so. He first began to pay rent when
Canmore raised corn enough to live upon. Forbes
raised five quarters over and above what his
neighbour could procure from his land; and then
the agent came upon Forbes for rent, and he
was willing to pay the surplus for the use of the
best land. Then Keith arrived, with his axe in
his hand, and two stout sons by his side, and no
other wealth whatever; so they paid nothing.
They cleared the land themselves, and built their
own log-hut, and just managed to raise food
enough to support them in the humblest way;
and thus they were living when I arrived in their
neighbourhood.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But why do landowners give away land in
this manner?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They only lent it to Keith till he should
have brought it into a condition to pay rent, till
which time nobody would have given anything
for it; and for this loan they paid themselves by
taking rent of Canmore. He raised three
quarters more than Keith, and was willing to pay
them as rent to keep the land he held.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then Canmore paid more than half as much
rent as Forbes?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No—that would not have been fair; for
Forbes’s land was as much better than his neighbour’s
as it had been before, and the difference of
rent ought therefore to be the same. Forbes
now paid eight quarters.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.73'>73</span>“That is, five for his land being better than
Canmore’s, and three for Canmore’s being better
than Keith’s. Then if any body had taken worse
land than Keith’s, he would have had to pay rent
for the first time, and the rents of his neighbours
would have been raised.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, and very fairly: for no one would
take land that was not worth cultivating, and
any land which produces more than would make
it worth cultivating can pay rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Forbes’s time, then, for growing rich,” said
Ronald, “was before he paid rent at all,—when
he kept all the produce himself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and a good deal of profit he made.
He consulted me how he might best employ his
capital, which was now double what he began
with. He looked about for more land; but there
was none but what was inferior to Keith’s.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he had taken that,” said Ronald, “poor
Keith must have paid rent, and so must Forbes
himself,—not for his new land, but an increased
sum for the old.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I advised him to lay it out rather in improving
his old land. He could not, by using double
capital, make it produce doubly; but he could
make it yield more than inferior new land: but
this raised his rent as much as if he had taken
in inferior land. If the new land would have produced
only three quarters, while the improvement
of the old yielded five, it was perfectly fair that
he should pay the surplus two quarters for rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, then, did you advise him to lay out
his capital upon his old land? Either way must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.74'>74</span>have been just the same to him in point of profit,
if whatever was left over was to go to the landlord.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By no means. Forbes had now a lease of
his superior land, so that he could take for his
own share all the difference between his present
rent and that which he would have to pay when
his lease expired. He went on growing rich,
since he not only made the fair profits of his
capital, but had the benefit of all improvements
till the time came for a new lease.—He laid
out more and more capital upon his land, and
though each time it brought in a smaller return
in proportion, and though each would cause his
rent to be raised hereafter, he went on improving
for a long time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What made him stop?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Finding that he would not be repaid for a
further outlay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What did he do with his money then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He came to the surveyor and agent, and
told them that the corn raised would sell much
higher if there was an easier way of getting it
into a good market. There were so few who
wanted to buy corn within a convenient distance
of this little settlement, that it was sold very
cheap indeed, and was often changed away for
things not half the value it would have had in
a town. Forbes thought it would be worth
while to make a good road to join a canal on
which there was traffic to many populous places.
He offered to advance a part of the capital necessary,
if the agent would pay the rest. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.75'>75</span>was done, and all parties found the advantage of
it. Poor Keith began to prosper now, though
he had to pay rent, and to see it raised from time
to time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! Rent raised again! Every thing
seems to raise rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“High prices do, as a matter of course.
When the corn sold so well as to afford the settlers
a fine profit, other settlers were in a hurry
to come and grow corn, and the original cultivators
improved their land more and more, and
rents rose in proportion. Those who had long
leases got up in the world rapidly, and the owners
of the land were presently much more than paid
for making the road.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, Angus, rent seems to rise and rise
for ever!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would do so, if all countries were in the
state of the one I have been describing. Wherever
there is the greatest variety of soil, and the
largest demand for food, rent rises fastest. The
more equal in productiveness lands are made by
improvement, and the more easy it is to obtain
supplies from other places, the slower is the rise
of rent. Forbes and Canmore were expecting
to have their rents lowered when I left them, for
it was so easy to get corn in abundance that the
price had fallen very much, and would not pay
for tilling some stubborn soils, which were therefore
let out of cultivation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish you would tell the Murdochs this,”
said Ella. “They want me to think it hard of
the laird to ask rent for my fishery; and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.76'>76</span>say that the price of herrings will rise as fast as
the islands pay rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The laird can have no rent unless it answers
to you to pay it. You bargain for a mutual advantage.
He receives money for the use of the
land and sea belonging to him, and you have the
benefit of a good station.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They say that the sea ought to be as free as
the air, instead of rent being asked for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The air would be let, if there were degrees
of goodness in it, and if it could be marked out
by boundaries and made a profit of like the sea
and land; and again, if all land were equally
good, and all parts of all seas and rivers equally
productive, there would be no rent paid for either
the one or the other. The laird who owns all
the islands within sight, owns the sounds which
divide them, as if they were so many fishponds;
and if one part yields more herrings than another,
or, which is nearly the same thing, if the
herrings can be got out at less expense of capital
and toil at one point than another, it is very fair
that a bargain should be struck for the benefit of
both parties, whether the property in question be
land or water.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or rock either, I suppose,” said Fergus.
“If we sold the feathers of Archie’s birds, might
not the laird ask rent for the Storr?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He would ask a yearly sum of money, which
we might fairly call rent. The birds are not
produced by the rock as corn is produced by the
power of the soil; but as long as the situation is
so favourable to sea fowl as to cause a constant
supply on the same spot, it may be said that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.77'>77</span>yields rent as justly as when we say the same
thing of the sea; and much more justly than of
mines.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I used to hear my father speak,” said Ella,
“of the lead-mines in Isla, and of the high rent
they once paid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet the mines did not produce more lead in
the place of that which was taken away, and therefore
the lessees paid the proprietor merely a certain
sum for the capital they removed from his
property. They bought the lead of him, in fact, to
sell again. They bought it buried in the ground,
and sold it prepared for the market. Now, Fergus,
tell me what rent is, before we begin to
guess what I shall have to pay the laird, if I
settle near you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What farm will you have? Where is it?
How large?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Answer me first,” said Angus, laughing.
“What is rent?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The money that a man pays——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay; rent may be paid in corn, or kelp, or
fish, or many things besides money. Better say
<em>produce</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rent is the produce that remains to a
man——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ella is to pay rent,” interrupted Ronald,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, well. Rent is the part of the produce
paid to the landlord when his tenant has made as
much as his neighbours on worse land will let
him gain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True, as far as your account goes; but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.78'>78</span>clear or full enough. You do not know yet, boys,
how important it is for you to understand all this
rightly before you pay rent yourselves, and even
if you were never to pay.—Come, Ronald.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rent,” said Ronald, “is that portion of produce
which is paid to the landlord for the use of
whatever makes corn and fish grow in the land
or water which the tenant uses.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or, as we say, ‘the use of the powers of
production.’ Very well; this is what we mean
by rent. Now, what does rent consist of?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of whatever the richest has left over what
the poorest makes of the same quantity of land
and of money laid out upon it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just so; and therefore if your kelp-ledge
yields more than mine next season, with equal
pains, whatever difference there is will go to the
laird as rent. If I get the intelligence I talked
of from the market, you may make more while
paying a rent, than you would ever have done
rent-free, without knowing what your prices
ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Had Forbes and his neighbours such intelligence
before they sold their corn?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes; even before the road was made,
newspapers found their way across the country;
and afterwards we had intercourse with the towns
at least once a week.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I wonder you did not stay where you
were. The place seems to have been very prosperous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus answered, half laughing, that there was
another kind of intelligence which he wanted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.79'>79</span>and could not obtain there, or any where but in
Garveloch. Ella, seeing Angus’s eyes fixed upon
her, rose and bent over Archie’s bed of heather,
where the poor lad was still sleeping soundly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your sister’s wheel has never stood still all
this while,” said Angus to the lads. “She shames
us for being so idle. What shall we do next?”</p>

<p class='c001'>All bustled about upon this hint, and Ronald
and Fergus made haste to their out-door employments,
supposing that Angus would accompany
them. After letting them go out, however,
he softly closed the door, and returned to Ella’s
side. He found no great difficulty in removing
her feelings of displeasure at his long silence,
when it was in his power to prove that he had
indeed not been silent while he could persuade
himself that he had encouragement to write.
When Ella heard that he had been working for her
all these five long years; that he had supported
his hopes upon their tacit agreement when they
parted; that he had returned for her sake alone,
having no other tie than the natural love of
country; when, moreover, he declared his willingness
to settle in this very place, and adopt
her sisterly cares as his own; when he kissed
Archie’s forehead, and promised to cherish him
as tenderly as herself, Ella had nothing to say.
She shed tears as if she had been broken-hearted,
instead of finding healing to a heart sorely
wounded; and the only thing Angus had to afflict
him was the thought how much each had
suffered.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They that have called me proud and severe,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.80'>80</span>said Ella, when she began to return his confidence,
“little knew what a humbled spirit I bore
within me, and how easily I feared I should
forgive at the first word. They little guessed,
when they bid me not be so careful and troubled
about whatever happened, that all these things
were like motes in the sunbeam to me, compared
with the hidden thoughts from which my real
troubles sprang. When they half laughed at me
and half praised me to my father, as being like
a mother to these growing lads, they did not
know that it was because I spent on them the
love I could not spend as a wife, nor how glad I
was that my cheek withered, and that years left
their marks upon me, that I might fancy myself
more and more like their mother indeed. If you
see me grow young again, and be made sport of
like a girl by these tall youths,” she continued,
smiling through her tears, “you will have to
answer for it, Angus. Will you take the venture?
You were ever the merry one, however, and my
part was to be grave for us both. Are we to
play the same part still, to keep the brothers in
order?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the midst of Angus’s reply, the lads burst
in, crying,</p>

<p class='c001'>“The laird’s bark! the laird’s bark! and Mr.
Callum is standing at the landing place, with his
feet almost in the water, he is so eager to have
the first word. You should have seen him waive
us off with his cane.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is welcome to the first word,” said Ella:
“all that matters to us is, who shall have the
last.”</p>

  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span> <br /> <br /> INNOVATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“Stand back, sir!” cried the laird to Callum,
as soon as the boat brought him within speaking
distance. “I always doubt the soundness of a
plea which is urged in such a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Callum, though much dismayed, ventured to
reply that his enemies had told their tale first.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Through no good-will of yours, Callum. I
saw the race between your messenger’s bark and
theirs. It grieves my heart to find that, even in
a remote corner of the world like this, men
cannot live in peace. Angus, I am surprised to
find you engaged in a contentious appeal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus replied that he was as unwilling as any
one to quarrel; but that he would never submit
to see the helpless injured.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was thinking,” said the laird looking about
him, “that he who has the most cause for complaint
is the only absent one.—Ella, where is the
lad whom Callum took upon him to chastise?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Archie is at home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not dead or dying, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is already much recovered, and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! neither half-killed, nor even shut up
in the dark? How little a doleful story may
come to when told at noonday instead of midnight!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Much remains to be told,” Ella quietly
replied.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.82'>82</span>“Well, call the boy, and let us hear it at
once.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella replied that he was asleep, and that she
could not awake him, even at his honour’s bidding.</p>

<p class='c001'>Callum ventured to observe that the old laird
would not have suffered himself to be kept from
his rest at midnight, and be told the next noon
that he must wait the waking of a child. Angus
replied that blame should fall where it was due.
It was he who had encouraged the lads to seek
justice, even at an unseasonable hour; and, though
he knew Ella would not wake Archie this day
for the king himself, it was he who had told her
that the laird would not desire it at the peril of
the boy’s health.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You told her right, Angus; and Callum may
leave the care of my own dignity to myself.
And now to business; for I see I must be judge
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So saying, the laird proceeded up the beach.
All pressed upon him such hospitality as they
had to offer; a resting-place, food, whisky;—and
some presented the primitive conveyance of
their broad shoulders on which to ascend the
steep. He declined accepting any of these
favours at present, and pointed to a spot on the
skirts of the moor, sheltered from the wind by the
remaining wall of a ruined hermitage, and graced
and sanctified in the eyes of the people by the
stone cross of rude workmanship which retained
its place in the building. If the laird had been
internally ruffled by the occurrences which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.83'>83</span>brought him hither, his unpleasant feelings vanished
in the presence of the monumental remains
which he loved to contemplate. As soon as he
had chosen for his place a slab of grey stone
under which some one lay buried, half a dozen
plaids were ready to sweep away the sand and
rubbish which bestrewed it; and the judge took
his seat amidst as much deference as if it had
been the woolsack.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Murdoch!” said the laird, “you seem to be
in great trouble, and as you are the oldest tenant,
you have a right to speak first. What is the
matter?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“More than your honour can remedy; but if
ye’ll please to be merciful, Providence may bring
me through yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; let us hear. You cannot pay your
rent, I suppose. Are we to have that old story
over again?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Even so, your honour. We have had such
high winds lately that they have been the ruin of
me. My seed, both barley and rye, is clean
blown away with the soil; and the wall is down,
and I have nobody to help me to build it up,
for the boys are both tossing in their cribs at
this moment, and the Lord only knows whether
they will ever come out again except to be laid
underground.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is a sad story, Murdoch.” And the
laird turned to Callum to ask if the fever was in
Garveloch. Callum knew of no sickness in any
other house.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to your wall,” continued the laird, beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.84'>84</span>with the least painful part of the subject,
“I feared this accident would happen one of
these days. You had not built it up, I suppose?—No!—It
seems strange that, while your fields
were encumbered with stones and your wall
tottering for want of support, you should not
have remedied both evils by the simple act of
building up your fence. As to the looseness of
the soil,—how did you treat it this season?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch twirled his bonnet in his hands and
looked foolish. “Did you send in the track of
the cattle to collect manure?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” replied Callum, “that I can testify;
they collected a large heap independent of the
weed. It darkened the whole window as it lay
piled up beside the house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And when was it put into its proper place,—into
the ground?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch again looked foolish, and Callum
again answered for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In very good time, sir. You may be sure
I would not let it remain where it might breed a
fever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch being called on to explain why his
land was in bad condition if properly manured,
owned that he had moved the dung-heap to
please Mr. Callum; but not having time to
manure his fields, had stowed away the dung in
the shed next the room where the family lived.—All
the farmer’s misfortunes were now accounted
for. The laird told him that he was unwilling
to add to the distress of a man in misfortune,
but reminded him how frequently he had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.85'>85</span>warned that he must quit his farm if his own
bad management prevented his having his rent
ready.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will give you one more chance,” he continued.
“I will provide you with seed (it is not
yet too late) on condition that you employ at
your own cost such labour on your farm as shall
bring it into as good condition as when you
took it. You shall not be asked for rent till you
have reaped your next crop; and then you may
pay it in kind or in money as you like best.
This is the utmost indulgence I can allow you,
and it is enough; for, if you manage well, you
may easily pay for the necessary labour and
make up your rent too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch did not know, he said, how he was
to hire labour; it was the dearest thing that
could be had in Garveloch.—This would have
been true a few days before, but it was not the
case now. It occurred to Angus that he might
so recommend himself to the laird by the
management of Murdoch’s farm as to obtain
employment for himself on advantageous terms
the next year. The laird knew a great deal
about Angus, and respected his general character
very highly, but was not acquainted with his
capabilities as a man of business; and the young
man rightly believed that if he could testify his
skill and industry, he might secure a comfortable
settlement under the laird. He offered his services
to Murdoch for more moderate wages than
would have been asked by any other man within
reach, and they were of course gladly accepted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.86'>86</span>When the laird had declared his intention of
sending for medicine and advice for the two
boys, Murdoch’s affairs were settled for the
present.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella next approached to request permission to
pay her half-year’s dues into the laird’s own
hands. He smiled, and said she need pay only
once a year, and might keep her money till
Midsummer; but he frowned when she answered
that she had rather deal directly with himself, if
he would allow it, and take the opportunity while
he was at hand, as the money was ready. He
declared his displeasure at all quarrels between
his steward and his tenants, and was not slow in
laying blame on both parties. His decision,
when he heard the whole story, was far from
satisfactory to anybody. He secured good
treatment to Archie indeed, and full liberty to do
as he liked, but Archie’s family thought him
much too lenient towards Mr. Callum. Callum
was still less pleased to find that he had been in
the wrong from first to last.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus, to prevent a further outbreak of ill-humour,
hastened to bring forward his plea. It
was of a nature to please the laird. He complained
of the absence of intercourse between
the islanders and the people on the mainland,
and pointed out the evils arising thence to all
parties: the deficiency of some articles of production,
and the impossibility of disposing of the
surplus of others; the disadvantage caused to
the islanders, whether they bought or sold, by
their ignorance of market prices, and the difficulties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.87'>87</span>in the way of social improvement occasioned
by such seclusion. He had strong in
his mind other difficulties and other woes which
had arisen out of this absence of communication;
but as he kept these to himself, they only served
to animate his eloquence when speaking of mere
matters of business.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What you say is very true,” observed the
laird. “You have here more peat than you can
use, while in some of the neighbouring islands,
the people are half frozen in winter for want of
fuel: and Callum tells me that Murdoch’s harvest
having failed last year, two or three families
were obliged to subsist on shell fish for nearly
two months, till the men were too weak to work,
and several children might have died if Callum
had not come his rounds earlier, so as to send
for potatoes just in time to save them. He tells
me too that the kelp manufacture is mere child’s
play compared with what it might be made, if a
fair market were opened.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish your honour would be pleased to step
down to the shore yonder and see what might
be made of the kelping,” said Ronald.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will, presently. But, Angus, why does
nobody make the voyage to Oban? Who prevents
it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus supposed that nobody was sufficiently
aware of the advantage: the passage, too, was
a dangerous one for the island boats, which were,
in his humble opinion, quite unfit for such heavy
seas, especially if they had cargoes to take.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.88'>88</span>“Then why not have a proper vessel, Angus?
If it went at regular times to and from Oban,
and if, moreover, it touched at some of the
neighbouring islands so as to discharge their
errands likewise, it might surely be made to
answer to any one who would undertake the
speculation. Why do not you try?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus was strongly disposed to make the
attempt, if he could be guaranteed from loss;
but it would not do to venture his little capital in
the purchase of a boat, unless he were pretty
secure that it would not be laid by after a few
trips. The laird was willing to enter into the
proposed guarantee, so assured was he that the
interest of the islanders would induce them to
keep up the communication if it was once begun.
After some consultation, it was agreed that the
new boat should be started the next summer,
as soon as Angus should have concluded his
engagement with the farmer, and before the
fishing and kelping seasons began. It was to
make the circuit of the island on a particular day
of the week, and to touch wherever custom was
likely to be obtained within a reasonable distance.
The sale of produce might either be
conducted by Angus, or its owners might cross
with him and manage their business themselves,
as they chose; and the laird engaged that a
newspaper should be regularly forwarded to
Oban, which should contain the commercial information
most useful to its tenants.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You look very grave, Ella,” said the laird,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.89'>89</span>when this matter was settled. “You are thinking
that this new plan will bring neighbours
around you and oblige you to pay rent?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt it will, your honour; but I am not
afraid. Prices must rise before that comes to
pass; and if prices rise, I can afford to pay
rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a very different consideration which
made Ella look grave. She was thinking of
the summer storms that sweep the sound, and
of the perils of the boisterous sea which lay
between Garveloch and Oban. She fancied
what the anxiety would be of pacing the shore
or breasting the wind on the heights as midnight
came on, to watch long and in vain for her
husband’s return; or to see his boat pitching or
driving on the waves, or half swallowed up by
them. She shook off these selfish fears, however,
and listened to what the laird was saying to her
brothers. He was warning them to make the
most of their tenure while they had the whole
produce to themselves, and not to be in too
great a hurry to sell. It might be an important
advantage to them to store their produce till a
favourable time for selling; viz. in the interval
between a rise of prices and the establishment
of a rent upon their ground. He ended by proposing
to view Ronald’s line of shore.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald pointed out that, as the sea-weed was
to be cut only once in three years, and as it had
never yet been made use of in this place, he must
profit by this first season at the expense of all
the labour that could be spared. He and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.90'>90</span>brother and sister now gave their chief attention
to it, gathering with great care whatever unbruised
sea-weed of the right kind was thrown
on shore, and cutting diligently at low-water
whenever the sea was sufficiently calm to allow
of the weed being properly landed when the tide
came in. The hair rope, twisted by Ella, was
now brought into use. It was laid at low-water
beyond the portion cut, the two ends being
brought up and fastened on the shore; and when
the whole floated at high-water, the ends were
drawn in, and all the weed they enclosed was
landed at once. Ronald pointed out several
inlets where the weed grew plentifully, sheltered
from the surge, and remarked on the advantage
of a gradual slope of the shore both for cutting
and landing the weed, and for drying it when
landed. He showed the situation he had chosen
for his fire, and the nook in which he meant to
stack the weed as it became dry. The laird,
having a mind to discover how much the lad
knew about his business beyond the mere preparation
of the article, asked him a few questions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Would it not answer to you, Ronald, to give
up some of this large crop to your sister’s land
for manure?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If there was no other manure to be had: but
there is plenty of weed thrown on shore after a
storm, good enough to lay upon land, but too
much bruised to serve for kelp. At present,
at least, we have enough for both purposes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whenever your crop becomes scanty, will
you give over kelping, or let the land lie fallow?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.91'>91</span>“We must take care of the land in the first
place, I suppose, because we are sure of making
something by that; but the price of kelp rises
and falls so often, that we can never tell what we
shall make by it. Angus says, that if more
barilla is brought to London from abroad than
usual, we may find any day that a cask may sell
for next to nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if very little barilla comes from abroad,
it may sell very high.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, sir: but we should not know that till
the time came for selling, and it would not do to
neglect the land in the meanwhile, so little
else as we have to depend on. Ella is welcome
to help herself out of my stack, as often as the
land wants it; but that is not the case just now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How many tons of weed must you have to
make a ton of kelp?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald smiled at the idea of his dealing with
so large a quantity as a ton. They that made
for the laird, he said, reckoned that twenty-four
tons, properly dried, made a ton of kelp; and
this might sell for any sum between 7<i>l.</i> and 20<i>l.</i>
according to the state of the market. It was not
for him to think of ever making a sum like the
lowest of these in one season: but he did think
it would be possible, whenever he should have
the advantage of knowing how to deal direct with
Greenock, to make so much as to be able to improve
the moorland on which the pony was now
grazing. If he could see that ground turned into
a barley field, he thought he should have nothing
more to wish.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.92'>92</span>“Surely,” said the laird, “there must be much
waste in the burning in such a hole as this;—merely
a pit, dug in the sand and lined with
stones. It would not be difficult to make a kiln,
and Fergus could furnish you with peat, if he has
enough to spare to sell, as I am told he has;
could not you make a saving in this way?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We might in one respect, your honour; but
we should lose more in another. As it is, the
weed is its own fuel entirely; in the other way
we should be at the expense of peat, you see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would have been well if some greater
kelp-burners had seen this as clearly as you do,
Ronald; and then they would have been saved
the expense of building kilns which they cannot
afford to use. But one great evil is got rid of by
the use of kilns.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your honour means the smell: but a little
care may prevent that being a great evil to any
but those who tend the fire, and they get used to
it.—When we lived northwards, we always had
three places at least where we might burn, according
as the wind was; and if it so happened that
the smoke would blow towards the cottage, Ella
used to take Archie, and sometimes my father,
to a place in the rocks where they might sleep in
their plaids.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And no great evil,” said Ella, “in summer
nights when the red twilight gleamed on the
peaks till midnight. I shall do it again when
the wind is perverse, and the kelping must go on.
The worst of it is that Archie loves sleep no better
than I on such nights.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.93'>93</span>“Is he frightened at being away from home?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, no: but he watches the fires till they
smoulder. If it is calm for a few minutes, so
that the tall flame can shoot up from among the
smoke, you might think you saw that very flame
in his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is ever on the watch for such fires,”
said Fergus. “It was but lately that he
pointed to the northern lights one clear evening,
and told me that kelping time was come again
over the sea.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why do you not carry him somewhere out
of sight of the fires?” asked the laird. “Does
he know the purpose of the removal too well to
be satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He does, your honour: and, more than that,
he must not be crossed in his love of what is
beautiful to the eyes that God gave him. God
has given him pleasures of his own, and he shall
never be stinted in them by me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella would not have spoken of Archie if Mr.
Callum had been present. Finding himself not
wanted on the shore, he had gone up to the farm
to inspect the condition of the family; and now
returned to say that the boys were so ill of the
fever, that he strongly advised the laird not to
enter their dwelling. Ella had, therefore, the
honour of entertaining her landlord, which she
did as courteously as any mistress of castle and
park could have done. She formally invited Mr.
Callum also, but he abruptly excused himself,
and hastened away.</p>

<p class='c001'>Archie was still asleep when they returned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.94'>94</span>the cottage. As the laird stood over him, and
observed his flushed face, he offered that the
doctor, whom he should immediately send, should
examine Archie before he proceeded to the farm;
but this Ella declined.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He wants rest and soothing,” said she, “and
that no strange face should cross him till he has
forgotten the last night. There is nothing that
gives ease so well as sleep like his; and there
are none that can soothe him like myself, if I may
say so; and no man shall so much as stroke his
head these many days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In her heart she added, “Unless it be Angus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The laird had no opportunity of showing that
he took her hint, for the time arrived for his departure
before Archie awoke.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.</span> <br /> SECLUSION NOT PEACE</h3>

<p class='c015'>Murdoch’s day of adversity—a day long anticipated
by his landlord—was come at last. The
fever ran through the family; one of the boys
died, and Murdoch himself and his daughter
Meg had the greatest difficulty in struggling
through. No use had been made of years of
tolerable health and prosperity, to store up any
resources against a change of times. Murdoch
had neither money, food, nor clothes laid by;
the most he ever aimed at was to reproduce his
capital; if he did more, the surplus was immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.95'>95</span>spent; if less, no exertion was made to
restore the balance, and he therefore grew gradually
poorer. He had already let some of his
land out of cultivation, and got his rent lowered
in consequence, with due warning, however, that,
if the estate was let down any further, he must
give up his farm to a better tenant. This winter
of illness having consumed more of his little
capital, he must have given up at once, if it had
not been for Angus’s care, skill, and industry.
The utmost that all those qualities could do, was
to keep up the place in its present extent. It was
in vain to think of reclaiming what had become
wild, of increasing the stock, or of making any
new arrangements of land or buildings; and
whatever was effected would not have sufficed to
pay the rent and recompense Angus, if the establishment
of a communication with a market,
and a consequent rise of prices, had not been in
prospect. Angus built up the fence, manured
the ground, and sowed it with the laird’s seed,
and then spent the months of winter in bringing
the place into such repair as might enable him
to proceed to further operations upon the soil in
spring.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Murdoch was so far recovered as to go
abroad and see what had been done, he quarrelled
with everything he beheld. This was partly from
the fretfulness of sickness, but much more from
jealousy of Angus. He felt, but would not own,
a considerable surprise at the extent of the repairs,
well knowing that there was no money of
his with which to carry them on. He affected to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.96'>96</span>be angry at the extravagance, saying that he had
always wished to see his place in good condition,
but had never thought it right to afford such an
outlay; and that they who took upon them to
make it might pay the rent. Angus good humouredly
explained that one part helped another;
the stones of the field to build up the wall, the
weeds of the shore to manure the soil, the turf of
the bog to cover the cow-shed, and so on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And pray, how is all to be paid at last,—the
laird, and you, and everybody?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Out of the crops, if at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye may well say, ‘if at all.’ The crops
never did more than just discharge the rent yet;
and here’s the funeral, and you, and the doctor,
to pay besides.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your barley and oats will sell higher at
Oban, or in yon islands, than the price you have
reckoned it at with Mr. Callum. When you go
with me to sell your crops, or let me sell them
for you——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You shall never do that, Mr. Angus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As you please, neighbour. As I was saying,
it will come to the same thing, if Mr. Callum,
knowing you can get a higher price than formerly,
takes less for your rent: I shall, of course,
be willing to receive my wages in kind, at the
same rate; and I hope you may find yourself
clear, neighbour, before the next season begins.
One ought not to expect more—”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch laughed bitterly, choosing to suppose
that Angus was mocking him. Angus went on,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now that you are out of doors again, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.97'>97</span>have a prospect of being able to work before long,
our business will go on faster and more cheerily,
and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cease your mocking!” cried Murdoch, angrily.
“You talk to me of work, and I have no
more strength than Rob there, when he creeps out
into the sunshine like a field-mouse in March, and
slinks back again, at the first breath of wind,
like a scarce-fledged sea-fowl.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see you are tired, even now,” said Angus,
offering him his shoulder to lean upon. “You
had better sit on the bench, instead of standing to
fatigue yourself; but, as I was saying, it is a great
thing to have got out at all, and the power to
work will come in time, and then all may go as
well as ever with your farm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch was in no humour to believe this;
he tottered without assistance to a seat, and sat
watching with many bitter feelings the exertions
of Angus, to whom he owed thanks instead of
jealousy for the activity of his labour. An idle
and unjust suspicion had entered his mind, and
never afterwards quitted it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He wants to supplant me,” he said to himself.
“He plies his spade with as much pleasure
as if he was setting his foot on my neck at every
stroke. He wants to have the rent fall short that
he may get the farm himself, and that is why he
tries to flatter me that there will be enough to
pay every body; that is why he talks so humbly
and smoothly about his own wages; that is why
his goods are all brought here and stored in
Ella’s cottage instead of being landed in Lorn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.98'>98</span>where all his kin used to live. O aye, he thinks
to settle here. But if I cannot keep my farm,
that is no reason why he should have it; and
Mr. Callum is against him, which is a good
thing. I have long meant to give up, and I will
do it now, unknown to him, that Callum may let
the farm to somebody else over his head. I’ll
be beforehand with him; and as for what I am
to do myself, it will go hard if I cannot get my
living by fishing if a woman like Ella can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This scheme was no whim of the moment.
Murdoch had turned it over in his mind as he lay
in the fever, irritated by confinement to which he
was little accustomed, harassed by grief, and
ready to look on the dark side of every thing.
While recovering, he had softened towards
Angus, and been sorry for the harsh thoughts he
had entertained of him; but mortified vanity now
recalled his jealousy, and he was ready, for the
sake of baffling the suspected designs of a supposed
enemy, to take a precipitate step which
might ruin his family. He now determined to
probe the intentions of Angus, and himself played
the traitor in trying to discover treachery which
did not exist.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder how,” said he, the next time
Angus came within hearing, “I wonder how
you would set about the management of this
place,—so well as you think of it,—if you were
the tenant.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The first thing I should do,” said Angus,
looking up into the sky and watching a black
speck which was wheeling just beneath the fleecy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.99'>99</span>clouds, “would be to get at yon eagle that does
so much mischief among the fowls. I think the
eyrie might be easily found, and should be if you
were strong enough to fasten the rope.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch answered impatiently, supposing that
Angus wished to evade his question; “I am not
asking you about the fowls, man. I want to
know what you would do with the land if you
had a long lease of it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would spend all the capital I have upon it
and get more as soon as I could, and improve
the powers of the soil to the utmost, for I am
sure it would repay me; at least if a market
was opened.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, that would be very well if you had a
long lease; but if it was a short one?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should still do the same. I would keep
the whole in complete repair, and try to remedy
the lightness of the soil; and when I had got
one good crop, I would apply the profit to
taking in again the land that has been let out of
tillage, and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is, you would do exactly as you are
doing now till you could get power to do more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Exactly so.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What a fool he takes me for!” said Murdoch
to himself. “He does not trouble himself to
use any deceit.—But, Angus, you forget that
your rent would be raised presently, and would
take away all your profit. You see mine has
been lowered since I let yon fields out of tillage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And have your profits increased again?
Rent follows prices instead of leading them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.100'>100</span>Your rent was lowered <em>in consequence</em> of your
losing, and mine would be raised in consequence
of my gaining; so that I should have clear gain
at first as you had clear loss.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hold your tongue about my losses!” cried
Murdoch, in a greater passion than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I beg your pardon, neighbour,” said Angus,
“I forgot for the moment that you were not well
yet, and I was led on by what you were saying
about rent. To put you in heart again, then—when
I was standing looking abroad from yonder
crag, I thought what a fine thing might be made
of this farm, when once a means of conveyance
is set up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I dare say ye did,” muttered Murdoch.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I saw far off on the north shore, grown men
and women as well as children picking up shell-fish,
and I thought how glad they would be to
barter for oatmeal or barley if a boat touched
regularly with supplies. I looked into all the deep
dells, and not a patch of tillage did I see over
the whole island but here, and Ella’s single field.
I saw the few lean cattle on the moorland there,
and thought that if the pasture was improved as
it might be, what a fine thing it would be for us
all to be supplied with meat. Then the sea
towards Oban looked quite tempting, for it was
as blue as in summer, and the islands as fair as
they seemed when I was a boy, and every rock
so well known to me, above or below the water.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; what has all this to do with my
farm?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, that I longed to be taking my first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.101'>101</span>trip; going with my vessel heaving slowly over
the swell, heavily laden with all our produce, and
then coming back dancing over the billows as if
it was no more than a skiff, and with little other
weight to carry than myself and the winnings in
my pocket.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you would wish me joy and long life in
my farm when you brought me my money, I
suppose?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be sure I should: as I do now, and ever
have done. Murdoch!” he continued after a
pause, “I cannot let you think me such a fool
as not to discern that you have some jealousy
against me. I have seen enough of the world
to know what is meant by such a smile and speech
as yours at this moment. Don’t let us have any
quarrel, for I know you cannot bear it just now;
but do keep in mind that I like plain speaking,
and would rather know at once when I have offended
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch waived him away contemptuously
with his staff, calling his wife to come and hear
the news that Angus loved plain speaking. She
joined in the laugh, and the invalid Meg came
creeping forth from the corner of the hearth,
braving the open air for the sake of witnessing
the quarrel,—a frequent amusement of highland
women. Angus meanwhile was wondering what
all this could mean, but was little more tempted
to be angry with Murdoch in his present state
than he would have been with a cross child.
Presently it occurred to him that they might be
offended at his never having alluded to his prospect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.102'>102</span>of marrying Ella, they being relations of
her’s though very distant ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You mean, neighbours,” said he, “that you
would have liked me to be more open about my
future plans.”—Here they exchanged glances.—“But
I left them to be told by the one, from
whom you had a better title to hear them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So he has spoken to Callum already,”
thought Murdoch, “and has the art to be beforehand
with me after all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you had heard all from that one, or by
some accident before you learned it from me, you
ought not to blame me, for you could hardly
expect me to be the first to mention it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would not have been delicate, I warrant,
Mr. Angus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think not, considering how the parties
stand to each other: but I am sure if I had
thought you would have taken offence, I would
have told you long ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And pray how long has it all been settled?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since the autumn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From the very time you landed?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From the very day after.”—Looks more
fierce than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And pray how was your proposal received?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” cried Angus, now angry in his turn,
“you push me too far. I have been meek enough
while your questions and your sneers regarded
only myself. I shall not satisfy your curiosity
further, and I am sorry I have borne so much.
You may well laugh at delicacy, for you do not
know what it is.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.103'>103</span>So saying he took a rope with him and went
out to war against the eagle, intending to ask
Fergus to accompany him with his gun and to
remain out the whole day as the best means of
avoiding deadly feuds. He left the Murdochs
wondering that, after bearing quietly so much
reproach and contempt, he should fly off at last
through delicacy to Mr. Callum. Never was
misunderstanding more complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was in the field when Angus appeared on
the height. She saw by his step that something
had ruffled him, and she hastened towards him
to know what had happened. His first words
were,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where is Fergus? can he go with me eagle-nesting?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How happens it that you have time for
sport?” replied Ella. “I thought the season
would be too short for your tasks at the farm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our poultry suffers,” replied Angus. “We
must demolish the eyrie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is not your only reason, I am sure.
Tell me what has happened.—The laird says
rightly that neighbours who ought to be the
more friendly because they are few, are often the
first to quarrel; but you would not quarrel, especially
with the Murdochs, and less than ever
now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would not willingly. I tried all I could.
But, Ella, when did you tell them of our plans?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never,” said Ella, colouring; “nor did I
mean it till summer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Somebody has told, however.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.104'>104</span>“Impossible; nobody knows it but the two
boys; and they might be trusted as if they were
dumb.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus explained, and both conjectured, and
the two lads passed their word that they had
never told. There was no catching the little bird
that had carried the matter; so the two sportsmen
set out in chase of the great bird which was
their further aim.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, Angus,” said Ella; “are ye certain
your eye is as steady and your foot as sure as
when this was your daily sport?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fear nothing,” said Angus, smiling. “I
long to be dangling over the surf again, with the
sea fowl flapping and screaming about me, and I
feeling myself lord, like a lion in a wood of chattering
monkeys. You see we take heed to stake
and rope, and that done, all is safe. I will bring
you home an egg that shall beat all that Archie
ever gave you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am glad your sport will be out of his sight,
or he would be wanting to imitate you. Do you
know, we have had to give him a cask to stow
his goods in, as we pack our herrings and the
kelp. Ronald has carried it over to the Storr and
put it under a ledge where it cannot get wet, and
Archie is busy filling it to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He learns to imitate more and more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He does; and so haste away lest he should
come and find out what that rope is for. O, be
back before the dusk, lest I should doubt your
care for Ronald and me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will remember Ronald,” said Fergus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.105'>105</span>laughing as he shouldered his gun—“I leave
the rest to Angus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus found that his favourite sport had lost
none of its charms for having been long unpractised.
He forgot his wrath when he found
himself alone with Fergus in the wild region
which the sea-eagles had chosen for their abode.
He loved it all the better for having beheld other
scenes of sublimity with which he could contrast
it. While climbing steep rocky paths, or springing
from one point to another where there was
no path at all, while looking round in vain for
traces of any but marine vegetation, and casting
a glance over an expanse which appeared to have
no boundary, he related to Fergus what he had
seen in the forests of Canada: how the grass and
underwood grow tangled and high, so as to make
it difficult to proceed a step; how the trees prevent
any thing being seen beyond the stems
around; and how, by climbing the highest, no
other view can be obtained than closewoven tree-tops
spreading, apparently so firm that you might
walk over them, as far as the horizon.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hist!” said Fergus. “There he sits! his
mate is just below on the nest, no doubt. Shall
I fire, or wait till he soars?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wait!” said Angus; and he paused to watch
the majestic bird, perched on the extreme edge
of a jutting crag, and apparently looking abroad
for prey. He was motionless, his dusky wings
being folded, his black shining talons clasping
the verge of the rock, and his large brilliant eye
seeming fixed on some object too remote to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.106'>106</span>distinguishable by human sight. Fergus was
going to speak again, but his companion stopped
him, only allowing him to intimate by describing
a hook, bending his fingers and shuddering, how
he pitied the prey that was even now fated to
perish under such a beak and talons. Surprised
that they were unperceived, and wishing to
remain so, Angus pulled his companion back
under the brow of the crag to await the departure
of the monarch of this solitude. Presently they
heard a rushing sound,—whether from a blast
among the crags or from the flight of the eagle,
they did not for a moment know; but they immediately
saw him soaring high and abroad with
that peculiar mode of flight which shows that
the eagle is not winging his way homewards,
but that there is prey beneath. His cry was
distinctly heard, even when he was scarcely
visible, and it was answered by one so near
them that they both started.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, now,” said Angus, “while he is afar,
up, Fergus, and fix the stake! Is your gun
loaded? You must shoot her as she hovers,
while I take the egg.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wait one moment,” cried Fergus. “He
will drop this instant. There, there! see him
pounce! He drops plump as if he was made of
lead. It is but an instant since he was almost
too high and the surge too low to be heard, and
now he is like a speck among the foam below.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With all speed, the stake was made fast, the
rope secured at one end to this support, and at
the other round Angus’s waist. When the knots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.107'>107</span>had been tried and found to be firm, the sportsmen
raised a shrill cry to alarm the mate, and
the one prepared to take aim and the other to
descend as soon as she should rise. In the
midst of the din she rushed forth, was immediately
struck beneath the wing, and fell fluttering,
tumbling, and screaming, from one point
to another of the rocks, mingling her dying cry
with the distant echoes of the shot. Angus was
by this time scrambling to find the nest, sometimes
dangling at the end of the rope and
buffeted by the sudden gales as they passed,
sometimes finding a step for the foot and a hold
for the hand, and a resting place where he could
pause for an instant. When he discovered the
nest, his heart almost smote him for thus taking
by storm the palace of the king of the birds; till
the sight of scattered feathers and of a few bones
reconciled him to the destruction of the formidable
enemies of the farm-yard. The large egg
was yet warm. Angus put it in his pouch, sent
the stray feathers down the wind, cleared out the
hole completely, so as to leave no temptation to
the enemy to return, and then ascended.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have been quick,” observed Fergus,
“yet there he is, just below yon cloud, and with
a prey in his talons.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“One can make more speed with an eagle’s
nest than with a gannet’s,” replied Angus.
“One is not dizzied with the flapping of more
wings than one can count, or stunned with the
din of more cries than one’s brain will easily
bear. Yonder bird is truly the monarch of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.108'>108</span>wild now. I could pity him, but for the thought
of our fowls.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I were he,” said Fergus, “I would
finish my lonely meal, and away to find another
mate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So would not I,” said Angus; “as long as
my dead mate lay below, I would sit all day and
watch; and when the tides sweep her bones
away, I would build again in the same nook for
her sake.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But do not you mean to carry her home?”
asked Fergus. “She lies within reach from the
shore. Let us go back that way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With all my heart, and as we have time, we
may as well make a circuit by the bog, and send
a shot each among the wild fowl. Perhaps
Murdoch may thank me for bringing such game
when he has forgotten my offences.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he does not thank you,” said Fergus, “I
know somebody else who will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The bird they had shot was in the agonies of
death when they arrived where she lay. Her
claws were rigid, a film was over her piercing
eye; a faint gasping through the open beak,
and a feeble fluttering of the extended wings as
she lay on her back, were the only signs of life.
Angus put her out of pain, slung her over his
shoulder, and proceeded to his sport where sport
never fails,—among the pools where wild-fowl
collect.</p>

<p class='c001'>No alarm was excited by their appearance on
the margin of the reedy pool where the fowl were
diving, splashing, sailing or brooding, as suited their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.109'>109</span>several inclinations. They seemed as tame as
farm-yard ducks and geese, and were, indeed,
little more accustomed to the report of a gun than
they: for Fergus had seldom time for sport, and
no one in Garveloch but himself and his brother
ever fired a shot. He now offered his gun to
Angus.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You disdain such game after having brought
down an eagle,” said Angus, laughing. “All in
their turns say I; so now for it.” And another
moment made prodigious havoc and bustle among
the fowl. As the smoke was wafted from over
the pool and slowly dispersed, what a flitting
and skimming and huddling together was there
on the surface and in the inlets; what a cluttering
and cackling of the living, what a feeble cry
from the dying, while the dead floated in the
eddy made by their terrified companions!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Two, four, five at the first shot! Well done,
Angus! If the bird-king be still watching us,
what murderous wretches he will think us!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will revenge his species, perhaps, when
the darkness, that is a thick curtain to us, is only
a transparent veil to him. He can carry off a
kid or a fowl at midnight as well as when he has
been staring at the sun. But I hope he will go
and seek society, for we have no more prey to
spare him. Come, take your aim, and then let
us be gone, for the shadows are settling down in
the hollows, and we have a difficult way to make
homewards.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was watching for them; not that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.110'>110</span>were late, but she had new perplexities to relate.
She had been up to the farm to try to re-establish
a good understanding; for which purpose she
made a greater effort and was more ready with
concessions than she would have been if the
family had been well and prosperous. On explaining
to them the reasons why she had not
communicated her intended connexion with
Angus, she was surprised, and scarcely knew
whether or not to be vexed, to find that they had
no suspicion of the matter. The interview threw
no light whatever on the cause of offence; and
Ella came away understanding nothing more than
that they seemed to think themselves injured, and
had refused to let Angus set foot on their
premises again till they should have seen Mr.
Callum.</p>

<p class='c001'>The affair was, of course, more mysterious
than ever to Angus, who, however, was less
troubled at it than his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will work for you and Ronald instead, till
Mr. Callum comes, or till my boat is ready for
her first trip. You will neither of you pay me
with abuse, and turn me out as if I had robbed
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shall not be made fretful by illness, I
trust.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; thank you, for putting me in mind of
that. I will nourish no anger, and will go at
once if they send for me. If they do, I hope it
will be while my game is good. I shall be all
the better received if I carry a handful of wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.111'>111</span>ducks, which invalids like better than smoked
geese that eat as tough as theirs. I wish they
would learn from you, Ella, how to cure their
geese,—and many other things.”</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.</span><br /> <br /> A FOOL’S ERRAND.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The wild ducks were still fresh when Angus was
sent for, as it so happened that Murdoch’s wife
came within an hour to say that the cattle were
in the rye-field, (Murdoch having left the gate
open,) and it was beyond the feeble strength of
any of the household to drive them out. Angus
goodnaturedly refrained from any reference to
what had passed, returned, and saw the mischief
the farmer’s carelessness had done, and made no
complaint thereof, but took his seat as usual
beside the hearth, and amused the invalids with
an account of his day’s adventures. The farmer
being, for some time after this, as irritable as
ever, Angus avoided all mention of their quarrel,
the cause of which, therefore, remained as great
a mystery as ever. Murdoch saw no mystery
in it, so prepossessed was he with the idea that
his assistant meant to turn him out and triumph
over him; and he founded all his arrangements
on this notion. His jealousy was ever on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.112'>112</span>watch, and he felt he should have no rest till he
could see Mr. Callum, give up his farm on condition
that Angus should not have it, and obtain
a promise of a cottage where he and his family
might live by plying their boat and nets. When
Angus returned from the field, one chill, dreary
evening, he found Murdoch at the door, looking
out for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where have ye been so late, Angus? It
has been nearly dark this hour, and a killing
fog.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I kept to my work to the last minute, neighbour,
that’s all. I had a particular reason for
working hard to-day——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, and every day, I think,” interrupted
Murdoch. “Only remember that this desperate
hard work is no desire of mine, and it is not to
come into your wages.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, well, but you will not let one speak,”
replied Angus, smiling. “I was going to say
that I have been working for to-day and to-morrow,
too, as I shall be on the sea the greater
part of the day. Mr. Callum is in Scarba, and
as I want to see him, I must be off early in the
morning; and if I should not find him directly,
I may not be back till night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Callum landed in Scarba! Who told
you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus pointed to the end of his telescope,
which peeped out of his bosom. Murdoch
peevishly observed, that Angus seemed to see
and hear more than anybody in all the range
of the islands.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.113'>113</span>“Very likely, as to the seeing,” replied
Angus, “for there is not such another glass as
this in all the islands, I fancy. I thank my old
friend, the surveyor, for it every time I use it,—that
is, every day of my life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you want with Mr. Callum?”
asked Murdoch, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What matters it to you?” answered Angus,
looking steadily at him. “I take your wages
for doing your work, but I am not answerable
to you for my private affairs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, certainly; I only asked because I must go
with you to-morrow. I want to see Mr. Callum,
too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely,” said Angus kindly, “you are not
strong enough for the sea yet; and besides, Mr.
Callum may not be near the shore, and there may
be miles to walk to overtake him. Let me do
your business when I do my own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch laughed scornfully at this proposal,
and yet more, when Angus offered to persuade
Mr. Callum to come to Garveloch. The farmer
was bent on making the attempt, and was not
deterred by the dreary weather of the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>They landed in Scarba before they supposed
that Mr. Callum would have left his bed, but found
that he intended to embark early from the opposite
side of the island, after having slept in the
interior, and that if they wished to reach him,
they must take horse, and proceed as fast as
possible. There was but one horse to be had;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.114'>114</span>and Murdoch, weary as he already was, would
not lose sight of Angus for an instant. He insisted
on mounting behind him, and thus, they
set off. The roughness of the roads, and of the
horse’s pace, irritated Murdoch, as every untoward
circumstance, however trifling, was apt
to do at present. From being sullen, he became
rude, surly, and passionate, till Angus began to
consider what mode of treatment would bring
his companion to his senses.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take heed how you ride, I say, Angus. If
you can bear jogging to pieces, I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The road is terribly rough indeed, neighbour;
but we shall find an even reach when we
have turned yon point.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Even! do you call this even?” cried Murdoch
at the end of a quarter of an hour, when
they began to descend a steep.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did not answer for more than the reach
we have passed, neighbour; and, what is more,
neither that nor this was of my making.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it was of your choosing; and never tell
me that there is no better road than this across
Scarba. You chose it to revenge yourself on
me because you could not make me stay behind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’re mistaken, neighbour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mistaken! I mistaken! Stop the horse,
Angus; stop him this minute! I won’t ride
another step with you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you mean that you wish to be set down?”
asked Angus, who thought he now saw a way to
tame his companion. “Do you wish to get
off here?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.115'>115</span>“To be sure—this moment, this very moment.
I won’t ride another step with you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus let him get down, and proceeded
leisurely. In two minutes, he heard Murdoch
calling him as he had expected.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me get up again,” said he in an altered
tone; and he began to mutter something about
the way being far for walking, and then held his
peace till they overtook Mr. Callum.</p>

<p class='c001'>This important personage frowned on Angus,
and cut short his conference with him as much
as he decently could. He smiled on Murdoch
when he heard the nature of his business, and
favoured him with an audience of unusual length.
He could not say, in answer to Murdoch’s suspicions,
that Angus had ever asked for the farm;
but they agreed that he certainly meant to do it,
and that it would be a great triumph to disappoint
him. Mr. Callum had a distant cousin
who was in want of just such a farm as Murdoch’s,
and he had no doubt he could influence
the laird to let it be thus disposed of, and to build
a dwelling for the Murdochs where they might
pursue their fishing. If so the workmen should
begin to build without delay, and it should be
seen whether Murdoch’s fishing might not begin
as soon as Angus’s traffic with his new boat,
which was the talk of all Garveloch and the
neighbouring isles.—Mr. Callum would not give
Angus the pleasure of hearing this, or the progress
which was making in the building of the
little packet; but he described to Murdoch all its
conveniences and beauties, and told him how the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.116'>116</span>laird himself made frequent inquiries about it,
and had been more than once to see it on the
stocks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The two plotters having by mutual sympathy
put themselves in mutual good humour, were full
of consideration for each other, and pointedly
neglectful of everybody else, when they returned
from their long conference. Callum ordered
refreshment for Murdoch, and recommended rest
without consulting the convenience of Angus;
and the farmer strove to contrast his own deference
to the great man’s wishes with Angus’s
independence of manner and speech. Both
moralized on the beauty of sincerity and the
foulness of treachery, till the supposed plotter
but real plottee yawned without ceremony. They
had rather he should have blushed or trembled;
but his yawns furnished a new topic to Murdoch
on his way home. In every respite from a hard
trot on land and rolling on sea, he discoursed on
audacity as an aggravation of malice, till, having
reached his own door, he underwent a fainting-fit
with a heroism worthy of a better cause.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter X.</span> <br /> <br /> WHAT IS TO HAPPEN NEXT?</h3>

<p class='c015'>No contrast would be more complete or more
refreshing to Angus than the state of affairs
below to that which he was constantly witnessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.117'>117</span>at the farm. With Ella and her brothers everything
prospered; and their external prosperity
was not alloyed by troubles from within. The
boys used in former days to think there was
no fault in Ella, and would have been highly
offended if any one had spoken of a time when
they would love her better, and be happier with
her. That time had, however, come. They
were grateful to her for the new virtue to which
time gave rise,—the virtue of remembering that
they were no longer children, and of surrendering
her authority accordingly, by natural degrees,
and before the change was demanded or even
wished for. She waited to be consulted about
their little plans, asked their advice about her
own, and, still better, not only smiled indulgently
upon their mirth as formerly, but took part in it
as if years were rolling backward over her head.
On her part, she felt that her brothers were her
friends because they loved Angus devotedly;
and, as for Angus, all was, of course, right in his
eyes in a household whose chief bond was attachment
to himself and devotion to the interests
which were most dear to him. He passed every
half hour that he could spare from his duties at
the farm among his friends below, now pointing
out what ought to be done in the field, now helping
Ronald to strew and dry and stack his weed,
now cutting peat with Fergus, now singing songs
or climbing rocks with Archie, but oftenest talking
with Ella in the cottage. He never could
carry his point of rowing her out to fish. She
always declared that it would keep him absent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.118'>118</span>from the farm too long, and that she had had
experience enough in managing her nets to perform
all the labour of that kind that would be
necessary till the herrings came again. She
could not, however, prevent his following her with
his eyes. He now prized his excellent glass
more than ever, and twenty times in a morning
he would fix it in the direction of her boat, and
watch and admire her proceedings. How delicately
and securely she kept clear of every
sunken rock, how steadily she plied her oars
against wind and tide, how courteously she answered
a salute from a passing skiff, how firmly
she stood on the thwarts to throw her nets, how
powerfully she drew them in, how evidently she
enjoyed setting her bark with its head to the
wind, and making every sudden gust serve her
purpose and help to bring her home! All this
Angus saw; and seeing it, pronounced that there
was no more fitting occupation for such a woman
as Ella than fishing; but then, there were few
such women—and he smiled at the thought.
He had seen young ladies angling in a trout
stream; and this was pretty sport enough; but
here was an employment requiring strength,
presence of mind, dexterity, and patience: it
was therefore a fitting employment for such an
one as Ella, and none but such as Ella could
pursue it with success.</p>

<p class='c001'>That success was great and well husbanded.
Ella remembered that this was, perhaps, the only
year that she might appropriate the whole produce,
and she therefore stored what she could as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.119'>119</span>capital to improve the quantity and quality of her
produce when she should hold her croft on lease.
She hoped to have money to lay out in improving
the soil, and not only to keep her nets and
casks and boat in repair, but to purchase a better
boat and various conveniences for procuring and
salting a larger quantity of fish. She wished her
brothers to do the same; and, to set them going,
made certain purchases of each. She paid Fergus
for whatever fuel was wanted for her own
purposes, over and above that which was used
for the common convenience of the household.
She bought weed to manure her field from Ronald,
and was pleased to find that he applied his
little fund in taking in the lot of moorland which
he always looked forward to rendering productive.
She went every day to see what was done,
and often listened to Angus’s prophesy that it
might be made a very serviceable field in time,
and would probably yield enough the next season
to prove that it was worth the tillage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus were affairs proceeding when Angus appeared
with a face of surprise, one fine spring
evening, and asked who could be coming to settle
in the next cove, round the point. As they
did not know what he meant, he proceeded to
explain that a dwelling was being built just above
the beach. Ronald had not been visiting his
shore for some days, and knew neither of the
arrival of workmen with their rude materials,
nor of any business of the kind going forward in
the neighbourhood. Nothing could be learned
from the workmen, more choice in respect of indolence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.120'>120</span>and awkwardness than even the Highland
workmen in general. All they could tell was
that they came by Mr. Callum’s orders, that they
were to build a house with two rooms of certain
dimensions, and to get the work finished as fast
as possible for the purpose of being entered by
the tenant at Midsummer. Murdoch only smiled
when Angus told the fact on his return, and said
that they must ask Mr. Callum what the new
house was for.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Suppose,” he continued, “your packet-boat,
that you reckon such an advantage, should have
tempted somebody to come and fish in rivalship
of Ella! What would you say then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What I have said before,—the more the
better, while there is produce and a market. A
market once opened, there is room for many;
and then there are all the advantages of neighbourhood
and traffic, while there are still enough
for everybody, and will be for a long time to
come. Ella will be very happy to pay rent, if
at the same time she can sell her produce to better
advantage, and buy what she wants cheaper,
and with more ease, and have good neighbours
around her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shall see all about it when Mr. Callum
comes,” was Murdoch’s reply.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, everything is to be done when Mr.
Callum comes,” said Angus, smiling. “This
new house is to be occupied, and Ella and the
boys are to have a lease, and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you, Angus?——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I am to take my first trip in my packet-boat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.121'>121</span>and——” Here he smiled again, for he
was thinking of another event which was to be
connected with this first trip; but Murdoch, as
usual, misunderstood him, and took this for a
smile of malice. “And I,” continued Angus,
“am to be paid my dues, neighbour, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That you shall be, I promise you,” answered
Murdoch, to whom the smile of malice
properly belonged.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was observed that the Murdochs took great
interest in the progress of this new dwelling.
They were now all as able to work as they had
ever been, the spring weather having restored
their strength; but their invalid habits accorded
too well with the taste of the family to be readily
given up. The father still muffled himself in his
plaid, and sat with folded arms on a large stone
on the beach, looking with half-shut eyes at the
builders, and leaving Angus to work his own
pleasure at the farm. Murdoch’s wife still complained
as much of her fatigues and cares as if
the cribs were yet occupied by patients in the
fever. Rob still kept his fingers in his mouth
and lay in the sun, when the sun shone, or before
the fire when the day was foggy. Meg and her
sister still disregarded their mother’s troubles,
and whenever they could make their escape, ran
down to play pranks with the workmen, and to
do mischief to their work as soon as they turned
their backs. All were clamorous alike when anything
went wrong,—which happened every day,—and
blame was divided between the two who
alone kept matters going at all,—the farmer’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.122'>122</span>wife and the farmer’s man. If the poultry were
missing, the cattle trampling the corn, the pig
oversetting the milk-pails, the eggs broken
among the oatmeal, the farming utensils injured
or not to be found, there was a contention
who should rail the loudest at mother or Angus;
and the only means of restoring quiet was to
turn out the young folks into the yard. Their
father alone was strong enough both in limb and
will to do this—their mother not having bodily
strength, nor Angus inclination for a scuffle.
Even this extreme measure only removed the
evil one degree, for the boy and girls, having
pushed in vain at the door, and thrown everything
within reach at the window, (which, being
unglazed, received little injury,) ran down to
plague the builders below, as they had plagued
the authorities above. Murdoch often swore
that it was time to give up farming, for it was a
kind of life to kill a peaceable man like him, and
then he appealed to Angus, whether he did not
say truth; and when Angus could not agree
with him, the usual reply of the bitter laugh was
sure to come.</p>

<p class='c001'>At length, just before Midsummer-day, news
arrived that Angus’s boat was on its way, and
that he might go in two days and meet her off
the coast below Scarba, and bring her home to
her destination himself. Mr. Callum sent word
at the same time that he should land in Garveloch
the next day from Oban, and expected
that every one would be ready to transact business
so as to occasion no delay. Nobody wished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.123'>123</span>for delay. Murdoch fancied that he should find
ease and domestic peace in a change of employment,
and had already thrown his pride behind
him. Angus believed himself within three days
of the marriage on which all his hopes had been
built for many years. Ella contented herself
with saying that her rent was ready; and the
lads were eager to be in possession of the lease
which should secure to their sister and themselves
the fruits of their industry.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter XI.</span><br /> <br /> UNDERSTAND BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN.</h3>

<p class='c015'>“Angus!” said Murdoch, the next morning,
“look through your glass, and tell me if you see
Mr. Callum’s boat yet. The day is none of the
clearest, but there is a gleam passing over the
Sound at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The mountains were wholly hidden and a dark
grey cloud hung round the horizon; but, after a
little patient watching, Angus saw a boat emerging
from the mist, and observed that a sail was
hoisted and began to swell with the breeze which
was chasing the fogs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have not seen such a bark since the laird
left us,” observed Angus; “and she is full of
people and heavily laden. There is company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.124'>124</span>coming, unless Mr. Callum is bringing over the
tenants of the new house down below.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That can hardly be, Angus; for the tenant
of that house stands at your elbow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, you can keep a secret, I must own,”
said Angus, laughing. “However, I am truly
glad, neighbour, that you think so much better
of your affairs than you did as to venture on following
two occupations.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When Murdoch explained that he was going
to quit the farm this very day, and should have
no further interest in it after receiving an equivalent
for his growing crops, he was surprised to
see how pleased Angus looked, and asked the
reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know how much I wish for more neighbours,”
was the reply, “and for improved tillage
and increased traffic, and you cannot therefore
wonder that I am glad to find that the soil
is likely to be taken care of now that I have done
my best for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But are you not vexed to give it up, Angus?
Would not you like to have kept it yourself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I!” said Angus. “I have something else
to do. My packet and Ella’s farm will be as
much as I can manage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I always thought you wished to keep
the management of these fields!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder at that. Our engagement terminates
to-day, you know. Was not that made
clear from the beginning, neighbour?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O yes.” Murdoch had no more to say. So
Angus proceeded to Ella’s dwelling, where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.125'>125</span>had promised to be present when the lease was
talked over.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Callum appeared immediately after landing,
leaving the new tenants and the Murdochs
to settle themselves each in their dwelling,—a
proceeding which took very little time where
there was but a small stock of furniture, and
where nobody dreamed of cleaning an empty
house before it was again occupied.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Callum explained that blanks were left in
the lease, which were to be filled up when the
parties should have agreed upon the yearly rent
to be paid. It was necessary that he should
survey the place afresh, and that they should
know that they no longer had the fishery to themselves.
Ella was prepared for this; but not so
Ronald, for finding that by tilling his piece of
moorland he had created a rent on his sister’s
field. It was in vain that he wished he had let it
alone at present, that he remonstrated, that he
grew angry: Mr. Callum was right, and kept his
temper, and was moreover supported by Angus
and Ella against the opposition of the two lads.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But Ella had nothing to do with it,” argued
Ronald. “It comes into my share, and it is
very hard that she should have to pay for what
I have taken it into my head to do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is no concern of the laird’s or mine,”
replied Callum. “We let the whole to your
sister, and all we have to do is to ascertain the
difference in the productiveness of different
parts, and to charge according to the average.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Besides,” observed Angus, “the case would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.126'>126</span>have stood the same if Murdoch or any body else
had tilled the moor. Rent is not an arbitrary
demand of the landlord, but a necessary consequence
of the varying qualities of the soil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Callum grew very civil towards Angus at once.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have seen much of the world, Mr.
Angus; and I dare say you have found discontent
wherever you went upon this subject of
rent. The farmers will have it that the landlord
lowers their profits.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the people,” observed Angus, “that
rent is an arbitrary tax imposed on the consumer:
each of which notions is as mistaken as the
other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot say,” observed Ella, “that it is the
laird that lessens my profits. He asked for no
rent while my field was the lowest soil tilled;
and he never would have asked it, if a worse
land had not been taken into cultivation. It is
therefore the different degree of fertility which
causes rent, and not the will of the landlord.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And when the people complain,” said Angus,
“that rent is paid by the consumer as an arbitrary
tax, they forget or do not know that rent is
the consequence and not the cause of high price.
Your barley bannocks and Murdoch’s look pretty
much alike on the table, and would sell for the
same price; but yours are produced at near
double the cost of his, and therefore Murdoch
pays the laird a part of the profits of his.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And very fair,” observed Callum; “and so it
will be with your fish in a little while, Mrs. Ella.
Murdoch will sell fish which look like yours, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.127'>127</span>at the same price: but it will have cost him
more time and labour to get them, and therefore
the laird calls on you for a part of the profits
which you have till now kept to yourself, and
would have kept still if the fish had not brought
a good enough price to tempt Murdoch to try his
luck.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus hoped that rent would go on to rise,
being, as it is, a symptom of prosperity. Ronald
wondered he could say so; for his part, he wished
there was no such thing as rent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus explained that as rent rises in consequence
of a rise of prices, and a rise of prices
shows that the article is in request, and that there
are purchasers able to buy it, a rise of rent is a
symptom of wealth, though many people err in
supposing it a cause.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Callum observed that many wished for an
abolition of rent, because they thought high prices
an evil in every case.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well,” said Fergus, “surely everybody had
rather pay little than much for a peck of oatmeal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That depends on what causes the prices to
be low or high,” replied Callum. “If I take
upon myself to forbid anybody in these islands
to buy oatmeal in Lorn when they have not
enough at home, or if a bad season should make
a scarcity, and prices should rise in consequence,
such a rise of prices would be an evil, because the
people would not have any more wealth to give
in exchange than if the meal was plentiful. But
if (which is a very different case) farmers find
that their customers have money enough to buy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.128'>128</span>more and more oatmeal, and make it worth the
farmers’ while to take poorer and poorer soils
into cultivation, the consequent rise of price is no
evil. It not only shows that wealth is increasing,
but also helps to increase it;—it causes oats to
grow where only heather grew before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But after all,” said Ronald, “the landlord
gets all the benefit of the change. He grows
richer and richer, the more prices rise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not so,” replied Angus. “Do not you remember
my telling you that there is a perpetual
tendency to render the productiveness of land
more equal by improvements in the art of cultivation?
and rent depends not on the quantity
produced, but on the inequality in the productiveness
of soils. An estate which once yielded
one-third of its produce to the landlord may
afterwards yield him only one-fourth, and then
again one-fifth, though he may receive a larger
amount of rent each time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This has actually been the case,” said Callum;
“and therefore it is a mistake to say that
the landlord has all the advantage of a rise of
prices.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should like to know,” said Fergus, “what
would happen if landlords had no rent, and so
bread became cheaper.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If landowners gave away their land! Very
reasonable truly!” exclaimed Callum.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I rather think,” said Angus, “that the first
consequence would be that there would soon be
no landlords. All land would be in the possession
of those who would cultivate it themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.129'>129</span>and then, in consequence of a fall of prices, inferior
lands would be let out of tillage, there
would be less food raised, and things would go
back to the state they were in centuries ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if not,” persisted Fergus,—“if they
did not sell their land, but lent it without receiving
any pay, bread would be cheaper surely, and that
would be a good thing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Far from it,” replied Angus. “The next
thing would be that we should have a famine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A famine from bread being cheaper!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; for you must remember that we could
not make the ground yield in a hurry any quantity
of grain we might happen to want. We
have already seen that land would not produce
more for rent being abolished, and we shall soon
see that it would produce less; and if less was
produced while the price was so lowered as to
tempt people to consume more, a famine would
soon overtake us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If,” said Ella, “we have no more oatmeal
in the islands than will last till next harvest at
the present price, and if people are tempted to
use more by the price being lowered, do not you
see that the supply will fall short before harvest?
And then again, the lowering of the price will
have made it no longer worth while to till much
that is tilled now, and there will be still less produced
next year.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In order to keep up the same extent of tillage,”
said Angus, “how high must the price
rise again?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To what it is now, to be sure,” replied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.130'>130</span>Ronald. “I see what you mean:—that we must
come round to rent-price again, even if the landlords
did not take rent. So, Mr. Callum, I beg
your pardon for being angry about Ella’s field;
and I will say no more against rent being paid
for it, or for my line of shore, or for whatever
will bear proper rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your sister has made you a sensible lad,”
was Mr. Callum’s reply, “and that is more than
I can say for most lads I meet in the islands.
They grumble at me, and tell all strangers about
the hardship of paying high rents, and the shame
that rich men should empty the pockets of the
poor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what do strangers say?” inquired
Ella.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They look with contempt upon the tumble-down
dirty huts in which the people live, and ask
what rent; and when they hear, they hold up
their hands and cry out upon the laird.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not distinguishing, I suppose, between the
real and nominal rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just so. They do not inquire how much is
for the fishery, and how much for the land, and
how much for the kelping-shore, and how very
little for the house; but they run away with the
idea that the total rent is for the roof and four
walls, and tell their friends at home how hard the
Highland proprietors are upon their tenantry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But is it not possible to make the people
understand the true state of the case?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Callum said he had never tried, for they were
a stupid, unmanageable set that he had under him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.131'>131</span>and only fit to do the laird’s pleasure whatever it
might be. He began, however, to think that it
would make matters very easy to have the tenantry
enlightened upon the subject of rent: and
when an amicable agreement was presently concluded
about the lease, and the blanks filled up
without dispute, he said to himself that it was
pleasant to have to do with reasonable people
where business was in question, while their independence
on other occasions was not perhaps
more troublesome than the ill behaviour of the
ignorant.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella, being quite of this opinion, was anxious
to know something of the character of their new
neighbours at the farm. As Mr. Callum said
little about them, and she did not choose to inquire,
she must leave it to time to satisfy her
curiosity; but she augured well from Mr. Callum’s
expectation that they would find their rent
no hardship, though it was considerably higher
than Murdoch had lately paid. The furniture,
too, of which she obtained a sight as it was being
carried up, was of a superior kind to what was
often seen in Garveloch, and nearly equal to her
own; so that there was hope that the family were
sober and industrious at any rate, and that other
virtues would show themselves as opportunity
offered.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter XII.</span><br /> <br /> A WAKING DREAM.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Not a drawback to the happiness of Angus and
Ella now remained, and a more cheerful family-party
was never seen than assembled before the
cottage the next morning to arrange the few preparations
necessary before the marriage, which
was to take place in two days.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus had finally given up his charge at the
farm, and received security for the payment of
what was due to him out of the growing crops
which had been sown and tended by him. He
was now about to make the circuit of the island,
and to touch at some others in the Sound, to
make known the time when he should take his
first trip, in order that the commissions of his
customers might be ready. Ronald was his companion
in this excursion, from which they hoped
to return by the middle of the next day, before
proceeding to meet the new boat. Fergus would
accompany them then to share the honour of
bringing home the vessel which was to be the
first regular medium of the commerce of the
island; and the next morning, Ella and Archie
were to be received on board and to proceed to
Oban, where the marriage was to take place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fergus and Ella were to occupy themselves
during Angus’s present excursion in improving
their arrangements within doors. Angus’s goods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.133'>133</span>had been stored in a safe place; they were now
unpacked, and served not a little to ornament
the dwelling and add to its conveniences. With
what a light heart did Ella pursue her employments
this day! How gentle was now her accustomed
song, and how tender the glance she
cast upon Archie, from time to time, as he followed
her to watch her proceedings and make his
strange remarks upon every new object he saw!
Fergus waited upon them both with all the quiet
heedfulness of a girl, while his manly spirit was
eager to be busy upon the tossing sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ella! What can this be?” he cried, as he
unpacked a bag of green baize which contained
some short tubes which seemed meant to fix into
each other.—Archie immediately snatched one
and looked through the ends.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He takes it for a telescope,” said Ella,
smiling. “It is a flute; Angus told me he
would play to us, some day. It is played by
blowing through those holes, I believe, and not
at the end, like the mouth-piece of a bag-pipe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fergus tried, and succeeded in producing a
tremendous screech. Archie first started, then
laughed, and employed himself for the rest of the
day in applying a piece of alder wood to his
mouth and screeching in like manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>“His music is as good as mine,” observed
Fergus laughing. “I cannot think how any
body can fetch pleasant music out of those holes.
I like a bag-pipe far better.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wait till you hear Angus play to-morrow,”
said his sister. “He tells me that he has heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.134'>134</span>some musicians play airs that would almost win
the eagle from her prey.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish he were such a one,” replied Fergus.
“I would fain have an eagle within reach, and
pin her carcase to our wall as Angus has done
at the farm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You would be a keen sportsman, Fergus, if
you lived within reach of better game than wild-fowl
that lie still to be shot. But, come, lay
aside the flute, and leave off handling your gun,
if you wish to be on the steep to hail their return
to-morrow. There is much to be done yet, and
I have a fancy that they will be home earlier
than the hour they bade us look for them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The boat was in earlier; but Fergus was
already watching on the steep, with Ella sitting
by his side.</p>

<p class='c001'>“All well?” cried Angus, as he sprang
on shore; “why then, everything is well, for
we shall have as much business to manage in
this first trip as if our boat was bound for the
port of London, instead of such a poor place as
Oban.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A poor place!” exclaimed Ronald. “Well,
I suppose travelling abroad makes one saucy.
I never saw Oban, to be sure; but I should
judge from the number of things you are to be
desired to buy, that almost any traffic may be
carried on there. Can ye tell Ella some of the
articles you will have to bring back?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are more than I can remember now.
One neighbour is going to try his fortune with a
flock, and I am to bring over some ewes with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.135'>135</span>their lambs. Then a rare housewife wants
needles, and her husband hemp to make nets;
and many need barley-meal to make out till harvest.
I am glad you are going with me, Ella,
for I am to have a <a id='corr135.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='commision'>commission</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_135.5'><ins class='correction'>commission</ins></a></span> for some woman’s
finery that I know less how to bargain for than
for sheep and hemp. I shall often have such
articles in my freight, for shall women be within
reach of caps and ribbons and not buy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You may reckon on beginning with me,”
said Ella, smiling. “I purpose trafficking for
caps.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was more in this to delight Angus than
would have met an English ear. The Highland
women wear no caps till they can assume the
matronly curch with which it was now Ella’s
purpose to provide herself. She led the way into
the dwelling to show how she and Fergus had
been employed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have been as busy as we, Ella; so now
let us make holiday for the two hours that we are
waiting for the tide. It is full soon to start
again: but the better we use the tide, the sooner
we shall come back for you and Archie. Where
is Archie?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the Storr since day-break. Would ye
let him hear the flute?—that is, if ye can make it
heard so far, for we shall not win him home
while day lasts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus went out upon the beach, and his companions
seated themselves round him upon the
shingle; and now, how astonished was Fergus
to hear what music might be brought out of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.136'>136</span>flute! Its clear sweet notes reached Archie on
his rock. He came out to the mouth of his hole
at the first sound, and stood intently listening
while Angus played a slow air, and danced
merrily when it was changed to a jig. As often
as it ceased, he clapped his hands impatiently for
more.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O Angus,” cried Ella, “ye have brought
a new pleasure to Archie!” and Angus took this
as it was meant,—as a strong expression of
gratitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How piercing the note is!” cried Ronald.
“If you played among the dells higher up, the
rocks would be long in letting the music drop.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if this sea were smooth water like an
inland lake,” said Angus, “I could make the
people in Scarba hear me. I have heard it as
far over water where there was no ripple and
when not a breath was stirring.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The lads had seldom known so serene a state
of the air as this, and could not even conceive of
waters that had not more or less swell.</p>

<p class='c001'>On looking round, Ella perceived that the
musician had other auditors than Archie and
themselves. The tenants of the farm were peeping
over the ridge behind, and the Murdochs
were stationed at the point of the promontory to
the left which separated their cove from Ella’s.
Though Angus put up his instrument, they still
lingered, at first hoping to hear it again, and then
being curious to see the preparations for embarking.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take care of yourself and Archie till the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.137'>137</span>morn,” said Ronald, “and then be up with the
sun,—bright may he shine!—and see us cut
across the Sound; and be sure ye await us at the
quay, for that is where ye must get on board.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It will save us a circuit if we push off from
the quay now,” said Fergus, “since we have to
bear down due south some way, and we can
easily carry the boat over the bar.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus thought the same. Just as they were
hoisting the bark on their shoulders, the young
Murdochs came up; Rob to ask a passage a little
way down the Sound, and the girls to keep Ella
company for a while.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Archie is in his merriment to-day,” said one;
“he has scarce ceased dancing since he heard
the music.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He knows what is doing now,” observed the
other; “see him climbing to the top to see them
push off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girls and Ella then walked slowly up the
path from the beach to a point whence they might
watch the boat set off, and trace it for a considerable
way. It was a bright and serene afternoon;
there were no rough gales abroad, and the swell
of the sea was no greater than in the calmest
days of that region. The air was so clear that
the mountain lights and shadows were distinctly
visible as their peaks rose one behind another
on the eastern horizon. Within the shadow of
the Storr, the water was of the deepest green,
while beyond, long streaks of glittering light extended
from island to island, and grew broader
as the sun descended.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.138'>138</span>The little boat pushed off from the quay in
good style, with two pair of oars, the three boatmen
of Ella’s household having waved their bonnets
and cheered before they stept in, in honour of
the spectators. It was necessary to pull strongly
and evenly till they should have crossed the rapid
current which flowed round the Storr: but Rob,
heedless of this, and remembering that he had
not cheered and waved his bonnet, suddenly
started up, threw down his oar, destroyed the
balance, and upset the boat.—What shrieks rang
from rock to rock, as the bark tumbled in the
current, and the rowers were borne, in spite of
their struggles, down, down, far and fast by the
sweeping waters! Ella clasped her hands above
her head, and uttered no sound after the first
shriek. Her companions ran hither and thither
with loud lamentations. The people at the farm
did what these girls should have done; they ran
down with all speed to desire Murdoch to get out
his boat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s one safe!” cried Meg; “the rock
is but just above the water, but he is sitting
upon it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O God!” groaned Ella, “save me from praying
which it may be!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another soon appeared on the same point; but
nothing could yet be seen of the other two.</p>

<p class='c001'>Archie had beheld all this, and more: he could
overlook Murdoch’s proceedings also from his
pinnacle. He was strongly wrought upon; for
no one understood better the signs of emotion,
whether or not he understood the cause. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.139'>139</span>acted with rapidity and strength, as if suddenly
inspired by reason; but alas! his energy could
only manifest itself in the way of imitation.
The moment he saw Murdoch’s boat hastily
launched, he ran down to his “floating place,”
as he called it, rolled his cask into the water and
got into it. Murdoch alone saw him standing
up and waving his bonnet, before he reached the
eddy, which could not but be fatal to him.—The
cask came up again,—empty—and floated
round the point, as Archie had no doubt foreseen
it would, and at length arrived within Fergus’s
reach, and was the means of saving him. He
clung to it, not aware of the nature of the friendly
support, till taken up by Murdoch’s boat. The
two who had reached the rock were Angus and
Ronald; and Rob had had his wits so sharpened
by the plunge, as to perceive that he had better
not leave hold of the oar he had clung to at first.
He too was taken up; so that Ella believed that
all had come safe out of this awful peril,—she
alone being ignorant of what had happened at
the Storr. When she joined her brothers on the
beach, they stood a moment aloof from her embrace,
with countenances in which there was as
much of solemn compassion as of grief. Angus
was down upon his face; Murdoch alone uttered
a few broken words. It was some time before
she could comprehend or would believe what had
happened, and then she was the only one who
retained her self-command.</p>

<p class='c001'>An expression of unspeakable anguish passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.140'>140</span>over her countenance as Fergus mourned that he
had been saved by Archie’s loss.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, Fergus,” said she, “let us leave it to
Him who guides us, to show whose life had best
be taken and whose left. God knows I strove
for this before I knew his pleasure; and now
that we do know it, let us question neither the
purpose nor the means.—Let us devoutly bless
Him that you are here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>While Angus took her home, the neighbours
dispersed in search of the body, which could not,
however, be found, and was supposed to have
been carried by the current far out of reach.
When all had gone home for the night, and her
companions had for some time retired to hide
their grief, or to forget it for a while in sleep,
Ella stole out alone, and passed the night among
the rocks,—a night, whose natural beauty was
worthy to succeed to that of the day that was
gone. It was light; and this it was which, giving
the faint hope of recovering the body, took
Ella abroad. The red lights of the west had not
wholly vanished when the grey dawn began to
glimmer, while, in mid sky, the stars twinkled
as if in rivalship of the sparkles below. The sea
was, as it often is in that region, highly luminous;
and as Ella sat watching the eddy within which
Archie had sunk, her eye marked, and not without
pleasure even now, the gleam which broke on
the crest of every wave, and was scattered in
showers of sparkles as far as the spray could reach.</p>

<p class='c001'>There she was found by Angus, at day-break.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have not been in his cave?” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.141'>141</span>“No,” replied Ella. “I will go there first
when you and the lads have left me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Left you! and when will that be?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In a few hours, I hope,” she replied, smiling.
“I must see that Archie is still honoured by
being kept apart from that in which he had no
share. The business of our days went on without
him while he lived, and it shall go on now, if it
were only to show that he bore no part in it. You
must perform your promises to our neighbours,
Angus, and discharge their business, and then
you can come back to me with an easy mind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will,” replied Angus; “and I will not ask
you to go with me this time. It is for you to
say whether there is cause for your remaining
behind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is; this once,—not longer, Angus.
I cannot give up the hope of laying Archie beneath
the cross beside my father. This will
either be done or given up before your next
voyage, and then I will go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For some hours of the morning of their intended
marriage-day, Angus and Ella were
wandering along the shores engaged in the most
melancholy search in which eye and heart can be
employed. At length Angus pointed to a sign
which could scarcely be misunderstood. He had
observed an osprey winging its flight for some
distance over the sea, and now perceived that it
was joined by another, and that both were hovering
as if about to stoop. Endeavouring to scare
them with cries, he hastened onwards, followed
by Ella, for some distance towards the south-west,
and succeeded in finding the object of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.142'>142</span>search. Archie lay, as if asleep, on a beach of
fine sand, still grasping the bosom of his plaid
which contained the gathered treasures of the
day.—Long were those weeds and feathers kept
as memorials of Archie’s pleasures: they were
Ella’s only hoard.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus returned from his first voyage with the
lads in safety, and in time to lay Archie’s head
in the grave. This done, Ella acknowledged
that no duty remained to prevent her fulfilling
all her promises. She accompanied him, the
next week, to Oban, and returned his wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>The classes concerned in production are (as we

the latter class is usually divided into two, viz.—</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who hold in possession the natural

<p class='c001'>Those who employ these natural agents, as
Farmers, or others who apply capital to land or
water.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of these three classes, among whom distribution

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2.143'>143</span>We proceed first to Rent, for reasons which
will appear when we treat of Wages and Profits;
and, for the sake of clearness, shall confine our
Summary to the explanation of Land-Rent.</p>

<h3 class='c025'><i>Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume</i>.</h3>

<p class='c026'>The total Rent paid by a farmer includes real
Rent, and much besides; viz. the profits of the
capital laid out by the land-owner upon the estate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Real <span class='sc'>Rent</span> is that which is paid to the land-owner
for the use of the original, indestructible
powers of the soil.</p>

<p class='c001'>Land has these powers in different degrees.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most fertile being all appropriated, and
more produce wanted, the next best soil is brought
into cultivation; then land of the third degree,
and so on, till all is tilled that will repay tillage.</p>

<p class='c001'>An unequal produce being yielded by these
different lands, the surplus return of all above
the lowest goes to the land-owner in the form of
Rent.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same thing happens when repeated applications
of capital are made to the same land for
the sake of increasing its productiveness. The
produce which remains over the return to the
least productive application of capital, goes to the
land-owner in the form of Rent.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Rent</span>, therefore, consists of that part of the
return made to the more productive portions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2.144'>144</span>capital, by which it exceeds the return made to
the least productive portion.</p>

<p class='c001'>New lands are not tilled, and capital is not
employed for a less return, unless the produce
will pay the cost of production.</p>

<p class='c001'>A rise of prices, therefore, creates, and is not
created by, Rent.</p>

<p class='c001'>When more capital is employed in agriculture,
new land is tilled, a further outlay is made on
land already tilled; and thus also Rent arises
from increase of capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>When capital is withdrawn from agriculture,
inferior, <i>i. e.</i> the most expensive soils, are let out
of cultivation; and thus Rent falls.</p>

<p class='c001'>A rise of Rent is, therefore, a symptom, and
not a cause, of wealth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The tendency of Rent is, therefore, to rise for
ever in an improving country.—But there are
counteracting causes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Art increases production beyond the usual returns
to capital laid out: prices fall in proportion
to the abundance of the supply, and Rent declines.</p>

<p class='c001'>Improved facilities for bringing produce to
market, by increasing the supply, cause prices to
fall and Rent to decline.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span> <br />  <br />TIMES ARE CHANGED</h3>

<p class='c015'>About ten years before the period at which our
story opens, the laird of Garveloch had transferred
his property in that and the neighbouring
isles to a large Fishing Company. The terms of
the bargain were advantageous to both parties.
The laird was to receive, in addition to the annual
rent which his island-tenants had been accustomed
to pay, and which did not amount to
more than sixty guineas a year all together, a sum
of several hundred pounds in consideration of the
improvements to be effected on the property.
As there was little prospect of such improvements
being effected, to the extent of some hundreds
of pounds, by himself or his poor tenants,
the transaction was evidently a profitable one to
him; while the Company reasonably expected
that the changes they were about to introduce
would much more than repay their advance—an
expectation which was not disappointed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.2'>2</span>Among the numerous fishing stations established
by this opulent Company, there was one
in Islay. A warehouse was erected, where salt
for curing the fish, hemp for making nets, timber
for boat-building, staves for cooperage, and all
materials necessary for the apparatus of an extensive
fishery, were stored. A curing-house, a
building-yard, and a cooperage were at hand; a
pier, around which there was a perpetual traffic
of boats, stretched out into the sea. A little
town had risen round these buildings, where
but a few years before there had been only a
congregation of sea-fowl. Where their discordant
cries alone had been heard, there now prevailed
a mingling of sounds, not more musical to
the ear perhaps, but by far more agreeable to the
heart. The calls of the boatmen, the hammer
of the cooper, the saw of the boat-builder, the
hum from the curing-house, where women and
girls were employed in gutting, salting, and
packing the herrings, and drying the cod, the
shouts and laughter of innumerable children at
play among the rocks,—all these together formed
such a contrast to the desolation which prevailed
ten years before, that the stranger who returned
after a long absence scarcely knew the place to
be the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor was the change less remarkable in others
of the islands. Rows of dwellings stretched
along many a favourable line of beach, and huts
peeped out of a cove here and there, where no
trace of man had been formerly seen, but an
occasional kelping fire. On Garveloch a fishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.3'>3</span>village had arisen where the dwelling of Angus
and Ella had for some years stood alone. The
field which they had cultivated from the year of
their marriage till the establishment of the Fishing
Company, was now covered with cottages;
and a row of huts, most of them with a patch of
ground behind, stretched from the bar on the
one hand, to the promontory which had been
Ronald’s on the other. Angus and Ella lived
in the old house; but it was so much enlarged
and improved as to look like a new one: it was
the best in the village; and it was made so for
comfort, not for show. There were nine children
to be housed; and both their parents knew
enough of comfort to see the necessity of providing
room and ventilation if they wished to
keep their large family in health and good habits.
They had worked hard, and on the whole successfully;
and though the perpetual calls upon
them prevented their laying by much in the form
of money, they had been able to provide their
dwelling with more convenient furniture, and
their children with more decent clothing, than
was usually thought necessary in the society of
which they formed a part.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus’s vessel had yielded him all the profit
he had expected, and more. Before the Company
was established, he had usually had business
enough committed to him to make it answer to
cross the Sound twice a week; and since the
fishing station had been opened in Islay, he had
made a double use of the Flora, as his boat was
now called. The possession of a decked vessel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.4'>4</span>had enabled him to share the herring bounty; and
he now gave his principal attention to the fishery,
only following the coasting trade in spring and
autumn,—the intervals of the herring seasons.</p>

<p class='c001'>As they possessed so great a treasure in this
boat, now of the rank of a herring-buss, Angus
and Ella thought they could afford to give the
old boat to Fergus for a wedding present, and
thus enable him to fish for cod on his own account,
instead of being a hired fisherman on
board one of the Company’s vessels. Those who
had only open boats were excluded from the
herring fishery by the bounty, which was granted
to the produce of decked vessels only, and which
therefore gave an advantage to such produce in
the market which could not be contested; but
there was a fair sale for cod, however caught;
and now that a market was always open at hand,
the possession of a boat seemed to Fergus to
afford a prospect of a certain and sufficient maintenance.
He married at one-and-twenty, a year
after the opening of the station in Islay, and in
consequence of it; for he fell in love with a girl
who had come with her family to settle at the
station as fishers. Janet was young and giddy,
and quite willing to leave her father, who was
only a hired fisherman, for a husband who had a
boat of his own; and, after a short courtship,
the young folks settled down in a cottage within
a stone’s throw of Angus’s house. They had
made a shift to get on till now, though their
family increased every year; and as they had
never suffered actual want, they began to think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.5'>5</span>they never should, and to smile at some of Ronald’s
wise sayings. Fergus declared that, if
one or two seasons of extraordinary plenty would
come, so as to enable him to get a new boat, he
should have no anxiety remaining. He had been
anxious when he had only one child to feed;
and he was apt to be anxious at times now that
he had five: but if he was but sure of being able
to continue his fishing, he would trust that Providence
would feed them as they had hitherto
been fed. But if these rare seasons should not
come, Ronald observed, what was to be done?
for the boat was wearing out fast. It must be
patched and mended to the last, Fergus replied,
and he must still hope for extraordinary profits
some happy year. He said nothing, though he
probably thought much, of the consequences of
a season of failure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald was free from all cares of this kind,
though he had had his share of trouble in other
ways. He was a single man and engaged in a
good business, and therefore well provided for as
to external comfort. He was a cooper at the
station in Islay, and as casks were wanted as
long as fish were caught, he had reason to suppose
himself supplied with employment as long
as the establishment should be kept up. He was
truly happy to be able to afford assistance to
her who had carefully tended his youth, and received
Ella’s eldest boy with the intention of
teaching him his trade. The trouble from which
we have mentioned that Ronald suffered arose
from disappointment in an attachment he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.6'>6</span>formed and long cherished. He had loved a
maiden who came in the train of the company,
but his friend Cuthbert had won her, and after
having made her happy for a few short years,
had been taken from her by an accident at sea,
leaving her with four children, and no possessions
but such as his industry had earned. The widow
Cuthbert lived in Garveloch, and supported her
little family by net-making. She was respected
by all her neighbours, and loved as much as ever
by Ronald, who, however, conducted himself towards
her as the widow of his friend, rather than
as the object of his early and long attachment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The widow Cuthbert was regarded as the lady
of the island, though she was no richer, no better
dressed, and, for all her neighbours knew, no
better born than any around her. She was
better educated; and this was her title to distinction.
No one else, except Angus, had seen so
much of the world; and even he could not make
a better use of what he had learned. There was
a sober truth in the judgments she formed of
people and of circumstances, which was all the
more impressive from the modesty with which
she held her opinions, and the gentleness with
which she declared them. Those opinions were
respected by all, from the highest to the lowest,—from
Ella down to Meg Murdoch. Her management
of her little family was watched by all
who cared for the welfare of their children, and
her skill and industry in her occupation were
marvelled at by those who did not attempt to
imitate her.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.7'>7</span>It would have amused an attentive observer to
see how a distinction of ranks was already growing
up in the little society of Garveloch, where
none had originally brought wealth enough to
authorize such distinction. Next to the widow
Cuthbert ranked the farmer and his family—the
Duffs, who were looked up to from their great
importance as corn-growers to the society. The
produce of their fields being much in request,
they had enlarged their farm, and improved it to
a great extent. By means of the more ample
supplies of manure afforded by the curing of so
much fish, and through the help of the better
implements and modes of tillage which their
prosperity enabled them to use, their land produced
twice as much as when they had entered
upon the farm, fifteen years before. They had
every inducement to go on increasing its productiveness;
for corn still fell short, and supplies
were brought now and then from other islands
to make out till harvest. Of late, indeed, the
demand had somewhat lessened, as an Irish family
had set the example of growing potatoes in
their patch of ground, and many of their neighbours
had done the same, with the hope of saving
the expense of oat and barley meal. Among
these were the former tenants of the farm, the
Murdochs, who, having failed in all their undertakings,
now had recourse to what they supposed
an easy and nearly infallible method of getting a
living. They had sunk from year to year, and
there was little hope of their rising again when
they began to place their dependence on potato
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.8'>8</span>tillage. They now filled a station as much below
that of Ella and her husband as Ella’s had been
supposed below theirs on the day of her father’s
funeral. Murdoch had not parted with any of
his pride or jealousy as he parted with his worldly
comforts. He still looked with an evil eye on
Angus; and, when disposed to vent his complaints
or seek counsel, went to new comers in
preference to old neighbours. He was particularly
intimate with the O’Rorys, who lived in a
cottage next to his own, and who were of an age
and in circumstances too unlike his own to come
into comparison with him in any way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dan O’Rory was a lad of twenty, who had
brought over his yet younger wife to seek employment
in the Garveloch fishery, as there was
none to be had at Rathmullin. He had not yet
been able to make interest for wages on board
one of the busses, and he had no boat of his own;
so he dug up and planted his potato-ground, and
was content, talking of future doings, but caring
little as yet whether they ever came to pass.
One evil of their coming to pass, indeed, would
be that there would be no longer time for talk,
which Dan loved full as well as did Noreen, his
wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, when Noreen was tired of her husband,
and had gently turned him out of his cabin,
he strolled to Murdoch’s door, and lay down to
bask in a July sun, his head resting on the
wooden step, his fingers stuck into his hair, and
his feet reposing among the fishy remains which
lay as usual strewed round the door, and saluting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.9'>9</span>more senses than one of the passers by. Hearing
a step on the shingle, Dan half opened his
eyes, and saw Murdoch approaching with a leaky
barrel on his shoulder, from the seams of which
the red pickle was dropping down his clothes and
meandering over his face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Them are the briny tears for which ye’ll be
never the worse,” cried Dan. “I’d weep such
tears every day, if the powers would give me
leave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get up, Dan, can’t ye, and let me come in
at my own door.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With all the pleasure in life,” said Dan,
pushing the door open, and withdrawing himself
as little as was necessary to let Murdoch pass.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Eh! it’s the herrings back again! O, father,
what will ye do for the money? What good
does the bounty do to them that can’t sell their
fish?” resounded from the inside of the cottage
in shrill tones of anger.</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch swore at the bounty and the Company,
and its officers, and at those who, he said,
supplanted him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, but what did they say this time?”
inquired his wife. “I took the largest barrel we
had,—if it did not hold thirty-two gallons, there’s
not one in the island that does.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They did not dispute that this time; how
should they? But they say, not a cask that
leaks shall be branded for the bounty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never deny the leaking,” said Dan, looking
in from the door. “Your own head is pickled
as fine as if it stood for the bounty.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.10'>10</span>Murdoch took no notice of him, but went on
impatiently. “And for the rest of the complaint,
I may thank you, wife, or Meg, or both
of ye. There is not a fish clean gutted in the
barrel; there is not one untainted with the sun;
and besides, the cask is half full of salt. You
women may raise the rent-money as well as you
can, for I shall never do it if this is the way
you help me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Meg began to complain that the boat was so
foul that the fish were tainted before they came
ashore; that her mother had given her something
else to do when she should have been curing
the fish; that Rob had carried off the knife, so
that she was obliged to gut them with her fingers;
and that, as her mother would have a
large barrel and her father would not catch more
fish, what could be done but to fill up the cask
with salt? The quarrel was beginning to run
high, when Dan interfered to divert the course
of the storm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder,” said he, “ye submit to be troubled
with the villains that carry themselves so
high. I’d leave them to catch their own fish,
and keep cool and comfortable at home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We must live, Dan; so you talk only nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True, neighbour; all that are not gentlemen
must live. But there’s nothing in life easier
than to live without their help; and I’d be proud
to do it, if it were only to see them standing and
standing all day, and many days, to see the
shoals go by, and never a boat out to catch a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.11'>11</span>fish for them. I’d go ten miles any day to see
them stand idle, with all their sheds and cranes,
and the new pier with the boats lying about it
as if all the world was asleep. There would be
easy work for a summer’s day!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Easy enough for them, Dan, but hard enough
for us that have not our pockets full of money
like them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never mind the money; where’s the money
that will buy such a sunshine as this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If people like the sunshine as well with bare
limbs and an empty stomach, Dan, I have nothing
to say to them. For my part, I begin to
feel the north wind chilling, now I am growing
old; and I can’t fish till I have had my morning
meal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, the morning meal is the pleasantest
thing in nature when it gives one no trouble;
and if you would do as I do, you would have one
every day in the year, without giving a triumph
to them villains. Just bestir yourself to plant
your potatoes, and then you are provided without
more words. O, people should go to old Ireland
to learn how to live!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought Ireland had been a bad place to
live in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Devil a bit, neighbour. It is the cheerfullest,
brightest land the saints reign over,—glory to
them for it!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then what brought you here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just somebody told Noreen’s father that one
might fish guineas in these seas; so he had us
married, and sent us over; but, as I tell Noreen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.12'>12</span>there is less gold here than at Rathmullin, seeing
that the sun shines one half less. But we
make ourselves content, as they do in Ireland;
and that a man may do all the world over—let
alone a woman that has a gentle cratur like me
for a husband.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But how would you have me make myself
content, when I can’t sell my fish either fresh or
salted? I thought you had had more feeling for
your neighbours, Dan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I! God help me, I’m as tinder-hearted as a
lord’s lady. It is because I am so tinder-hearted
that I would have nobody bother themselves.
Just give a man a cabin, and a bit of ground,
and a spade, and a girl for a wife to crown all,
and why should he trouble himself till the stars
fall out of the sky?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And is that the way you do in Ireland?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just so; and that is why Ireland is better
than any other land.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I have more to provide for than my
wife,” said Murdoch, casting a look towards his
little field.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Make Rob dig it for you the first year,”
said Dan; “and if there is potatoes enough,
well and good; and if not, go fish for what is
wanting, or let Rob get a potato-ground for
himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But we shall want clothes, and money for
rent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell the Company you’ll work out the rent,
or sell your boat for it, or beseech the saints that
love to help. Any way better than bother yourself.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.13'>13</span>“Anything rather than bother myself,” repeated
Murdoch to himself, under the united
provocations of heat, fatigue, disappointment,
and jealousy. “I’ll be free of them all, and
never trouble myself to offer another fish to any
man breathing. I can get fowl to help out our
potatoes, and then we shall do well enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At this moment he saw farmer Duff approaching,
and gave the hint to Dan, that he should
observe how the farmer would behave when it
should appear that he was to have no more
custom from either family.</p>

<p class='c001'>Duff declined the seat offered him by Murdoch’s
wife, as his first desire was to get to windward
of that which strewed the ground where
Meg had been curing fish. He asked Murdoch
to walk a little way with him; but as Murdoch
declined, Duff took the liberty of closing the
door, and attempting to open the shutter which
occupied the unglazed <a id='corr13.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='window.”'>window.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_13.20'><ins class='correction'>window.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“I live on the height, you know,” said he,
“and out of the way of your kind of business,
so that I may seem to you over nice; but I was
going to offer to relieve you of this litter. I
have been round the village to engage for all the
offal of the season, and I will take up yours at
the same price with the rest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can’t spare it, farmer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, just as you please; but I really hope
you are going to remove it directly, for your
health’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I trust my health will serve me to sow and
gather many a crop that shall cost me less than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.14'>14</span>your oatmeal, and be more wholesome than the
pickles in yonder barrel. I have done with herrings
for ever. Do you know any one that wants
a boat, farmer?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“More than you have boats to sell. There’s
Dan, for one. Dan, you mean to be a fisherman?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps I may, if the station offers me a
place in a buss without any trouble; but I could
not bother myself with a boat. Murdoch and I
are content to be easy with our potatoes, no
offence to you, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“None whatever. The only offence in the
case is the offence of a wet season, if such a
one should come;—where will the offence be
then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“After a wet season comes a dry,” said Dan;
“and the powers will preserve us to witness it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me see your boat,” said Duff. “Your
relation Fergus was looking at his this morning
as if he thought it would bear little more
patching.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mine is nearly as old as his, but it will last
a few fair seasons yet, I expect. I will make
him the offer of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Duff was going there now; and having no
more time to spare, Murdoch and he set off
together, leaving Dan to bask as before, or to
vary his amusements by watching the flow of the
tide.</p>

<p class='c001'>As they went, they looked in on Ella, with
whom Duff wished to negociate as with Murdoch.
Ella was in the shed built for a curing-house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.15'>15</span>surrounded by her children, three or four
of whom were assisting her in her employment
of salting and packing herrings, and the rest
amusing themselves with playing hide and seek
among the barrels.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What a store of new barrels!” exclaimed
Murdoch: “You must lose much by the old
ones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not at all,” replied Ella: “they serve for
our coasting trade when they will no longer do
for the Company. If we often got such a cask
as this,” pointing to one beside her, “we should
seldom have to buy. Kenneth made that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your boy Kenneth!” exclaimed Murdoch.
“Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He has been well taught by his uncle,” said
Duff, “and has good materials. See, the staves
are half an inch thick, and even throughout, and
the flags laid between the seams at both ends,
and the hoops as regular and well fastened as
Ronald himself could have made them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will only waste such a barrel,” said
Murdoch, “if you let the children touch the
fish. My Meg has wasted tons of fish and
bushels of salt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Little Annie, who was sprinkling the salt at
this moment, turned very red, and looked at her
mother as petitioning for a defence. Ella
smiled as she invited Murdoch to look and see
how evenly the fish were packed, and told him
that there was a trial of skill among the children
this day, and that it was to be determined, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.16'>16</span>her husband came home, whether Annie’s salting
was worthy of Kenneth’s barrel.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kenneth is not to see till all is done,” said
Annie; “he is helping uncle Fergus to mend
his boat, and uncle Fergus says he will make it
last much longer than any body else could do
but uncle Ronald.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ronald sent him this very morning, when
he was most wanted,” said Ella. “His father
should have seen the landing. He brought me
this barrel as a present, and he himself thought
of bringing his tools and some staves in case
Fergus’s boat wanted mending, which it did
sadly. You will excuse our going on with our
work, neighbours, for you know it will not do
to lose time in this weather; but the little ones
will get you all you want if you will step within.
Go, my little maids, and set out the bannocks
and the cheese, and I will bring the whisky.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Duff could not stay, however, longer than to
settle when to send his pony and panniers for
the offal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely that cannot be little Kenneth!” exclaimed
Murdoch, when, guided by the echo of
hammering among the rocks, they came in sight
of a fine tall lad repairing a boat. “Yes, it is
Kenneth, so like his father, and just as handsome!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth looked modestly happy when his
uncle declared that he did not want to purchase
Murdoch’s boat, as he believed his own would
be the best of the two by the time Kenneth went
back to Islay.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.17'>17</span>Murdoch wondered why his children gave
nothing but trouble while they were young, and
did little but damage now that they were grown
up, while other people made a profit of theirs.
He took a poor price, paid in produce, from a
cottager for his crazy boat, and went home wishing
that he had sent Rob to learn something at
the station, as he could teach him nothing at
home.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span> <br /> <br /> NEIGHBOURLY CHAT</h3>

<p class='c015'>At a late hour of this night, the young widow
Cuthbert was still busy, as she had been all day,
at her employment of net-making. The song
with which she lulled her infant to sleep had
long ceased, and she pursued her work in perfect
silence by the dim light of her solitary lamp;
her thoughts were alternately with the children
who lay sleeping around her, and with the husband
whose place of long repose was beneath
the waters. As often as a little hand stirred
above the coverlid, or a rosy cheek was turned
upon its pillow, the anxious mother gazed and
watched, and as often as the gust swept past, or
a larger billow broke upon the shingle, her heart
throbbed as if she was still awaiting the return
of him who should never more return. She
started, at length, on hearing a tap at her door.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.18'>18</span>“It is only Ella,” said a voice from the outside;
and the widow hastened to open the door.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your husband, your husband!” she exclaimed;
“no ill to him I trust. You are not
in fear for him, Ella?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is safe home, thank Him who guides the
storms!” replied Ella: “but it is a gusty
night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye look cold and your plaid drips,” said
the widow, setting down the lamp, and applying
more fuel to her smouldering fire. “What brings
ye here so late, Ella?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only a message from Angus about the nets,
which I should have left till the morn, but that
Kenneth and I saw a glimmer beneath your
door, and I knew I should find you at your
occupation. We press you too close for your
work, Katie. It’s an ill thing for sad hearts to
watch so late. Better that we should do without
our nets, than that you should look as you do
now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis for my bairns,” said Katie, “or I
would not undergo it. O, Ella! I have been
jealous of you these two hours past, if, as I
supposed, you were on the rock looking out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No wonder, Katie; and yet I could have
found in my heart to be jealous of Fergus’s wife,
and all the wives that were serving their husbands
by the fireside, instead of breasting the
wind, and mistaking every jet of the surge for a
sail, as I have been doing since the sun went
down. But I had Kenneth to while away the
time with, and help to keep in the light. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.19'>19</span>showed me how they hoist the lanterns at the
station, and our signals will be better managed
from this night forward. O Katie, you must
see Kenneth, and I must tell you all that his
uncle has done for him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But your husband,” interrupted the widow;
“how long was he? and in what style did his
boat come ashore? and which of you first saw
him? and——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, Katie, why will ye be ever asking
such questions as you know it wounds me to
answer? I have told you he is home safe. He
has brought such a store of fish, that, busy as
the curers have been on board, there is as much
left for the lassies and me to do to-morrow as
we can finish before the twenty-four hours are
gone. And that reminds me of the nets: Angus
must have those he ordered within three days, he
bids me tell you; but let us look about for some
one to help you, instead of your toiling with
your fingers, and harassing your spirits through
the night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We must toil while the season lasts,” replied
Katie; “and as for the wear of spirits,” she
continued smiling, “that is all fancy, and must
be got over. I have nothing now to tremble
for—no need to listen and look out, and I must
learn not to heed the storm further than to be
thankful that my bairns have about them all
that makes a storm harmless. If this was a
time of hardship, Ella, like some that have been
known here, how I might have envied some who
were kept watching, not by cold or hunger, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.20'>20</span>only by having more employment than they could
finish in the day!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a rich season, indeed,” said Ella. “The
shoals are such as Angus never saw before, for
the multitude and the quality of the fish; and
what is more, the crops are coming up kindly,
and farmer Duff says that he reckons on the
best harvest he has had since he took the farm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank God!” exclaimed Katie. “This
plenty may prevent the price from rising, and
nothing else could. It almost frightens me sometimes
when I see the numbers that are growing
up, to think how we are to get oat and barley
meal for them all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you had been here all the sixteen years
since I first came to this bay,” said Ella, “you
would wonder at the change, and be thankful to
see how improvements have risen as wants increased.
Now trim your lamp, and go on with
your business; it will be some time yet before
my husband and Kenneth have finished with the
boat and come for me.—Surely you make your
meshes more than an inch wide;—no, the exact
measure.—Well, that is one of the improvements
I speak of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was folly, indeed,” replied Katie, “to use
such nets as I used to make—nets that caught
the fry and let the full grown go free. That was
the quickest way to make every season worse
than the last. Then there are the boats, so
much safer from having pumps, so much more
favourable to the fish from being cleaner, and so
much better built, that our fishers need not lose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.21'>21</span>their time in short trips, but can push out into
the deep seas, and stay many days together. All
these things help to make fishing profitable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Besides,” said Ella, “they help farming,
which is of as much importance to us as the
fishing. Corn from abroad is so dear, that we
should be little better off than before, if farmer
Duff did not grow more than Murdoch once
did.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The people in the other islands and in Lorn
want all they can grow as much as we,” replied
Katie, “for their fishery grows with ours.
Meat and bannocks are as dear in all the countries
round as they were here last year.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then we may thank farmer Duff for all the
pains he has taken with the soil of his fields and
the stock of his pastures. He reaps just double
what he reaped fifteen years ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And so he had need, for there are more
than double the number of mouths to feed. Besides
the strangers that have come to settle, look
at the families that have grown up. Where Mr.
Callum used to spend a few days now and then,
there is Mary Duff’s husband and her five bairns;
then there are your nine, Ella—how your household
is increased!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There lies one brother under the gray stone,”
said Ella, “and Ronald seeks his bannocks elsewhere;
but there is Fergus’s tribe as well as my
own; and setting one against Murdoch’s son
that died, and another against his daughter that
went off with the soldier, there is still more than
double the number by far.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.22'>22</span>“Even supposing,” added Katie, “that Murdoch’s
daughter does not come back upon her
father with her children, which I have heard is
likely. But, Ella, Duff’s farm ought to yield
double and double for ever, if it is to go on to
feed us, for our children will marry and have
their little tribes as we have. If you and I live
to be like many grandmothers in these islands,
we shall see our twenty or thirty grand-children,
and perhaps our eighty or ninety great-grand-children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then,” replied Ella, “may God keep
us from the poverty that weighs on such! May
we never see our strong men wasting on shell-fish
and weeds, and our aged people dropping
cold and hungry into their deathbeds, and our
young mothers tending their sickly infants,
knowing that food and warmth might save them,
and unable to bring them either the one or the
other!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not let us think of it,” said Katie, looking
round upon her domestic comforts. “Providence
has blessed us thus far, and let us not
be too keen to foresee the evil day that man’s
power cannot remove.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was silent. Katie proceeded,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely man cannot remove that day, Ella,
though you say nothing. Let farmer Duff do
all he can; let every foot of land be tilled that
will nourish an ear of barley, still the day may
come; and what else can man do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella made no direct reply. Presently she observed
that Dan and his wife seemed not to care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.23'>23</span>for the evils of such a time, since they lived by
choice on the poorest food, and provided themselves
with nothing that they could lose in the
worst of seasons.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are content, always content,” observed
the widow; “and they say they have all that
is necessary; and they wonder that we can
trouble ourselves to obtain anything that is not
necessary: but I tell them we do not; I think
a chimney, and a window, and bedding, and decent
clothes all necessary for the children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Unless you would have them live like pigs
in a sty,” observed Ella. “When God gave
us the charge of these little ones, he gave us no
leave that ever I heard of to expose them to sickness
and hardship, and to corrupt them by letting
them live like brutes. By making them helpless
and quick in their feelings, he has shown as
plainly as if he sent a prophet to tell us, that
we are to tend them as carefully and keep them
as innocent as ever our labour and forethought
can help us to do. Whenever I see a little one
grovelling in dirt, or pining in want, or given to
vice such as it should not even have heard of, I
always feel as if God’s plain-spoken message had
been at some time misunderstood; either that
the trust has been wrongly undertaken or wrongly
managed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I knew you thought so, Ella; and yet what
can we say when parents see and mourn all this,
and cannot help themselves?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We can only say that if both father and
mother have considered and judged for the best,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.24'>24</span>and worked hard, and denied themselves, no
fault rests with them. Where the fault lies in
such a case is a thing that Angus and I have
talked over many a time. But such a case does
not concern those we were speaking of—those
who are content with destitution, when they
might have comfort.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The widow looked on her children and sighed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” said Ella, smiling, “there is no need
for you to sigh. You might carry your bairns
to Inverary, and match them with the duke’s,
and not a stronger, or fairer, or more innocent
would you find among them all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“May it please Providence to keep them so!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why should you fear? You have comfort
about you, and a prospect of abundance. Keep
your tears for a darker day, if there be such in
the years to come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Every day is dark to me now,” thought the
widow; but she kept down a feeling that seemed
ungrateful. Ella went on, anxious to cheer her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I watched your little Hugh this morning, as
he and my younger ones were playing on the
sands, and I thought he looked as if he was made
to carry his own way through the world. You
should have seen him managing the dragging of
the pool with the ragged net Angus gave the
children. You would have thought he had been
to the station to take a lesson of the superintendent,
by his direction of the rest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, I am afraid he is overbearing,” replied
the mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not at all; only spirited. If you keep him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.25'>25</span>innocent with such a spirit as he has, he may be
anything; he may be like Ronald himself, who
is so fond of him. O, he is not overbearing.
I saw him let go the net the moment little Bessie
was frightened at your dog that jumped upon
her; and he carried her through the water that
was too deep for her to wade, as soon as ever
she began to cry for me. Now I think of it,
Ronald did take him to the station once, surely.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; not very long ago, the last time he
was here; and Hugh saw the superintendent as
you suppose, and has been full of imitation of all
that he saw ever since.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He may be superintendent himself some
day or other, Katie. But does not he love Ronald
very much?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very much; as he ought to do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All my children do,” replied Ella. “It is
always a happy time when uncle Ronald comes.
The same man that the officers respect above all
who are under them is as much beloved by the
little ones as if he were a soft-hearted girl.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You had the making of Ronald, and I give
you joy of your work,” said the widow.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, Katie, that is the way you always silence
me about Ronald,” said Ella, smiling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, then, tell me about Fergus: he is
your work too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know all I can say about him,” said
Ella, sighing. “You know my pride in him,
and that this very pride makes me the more
grieved when I see his temper harassed and
soured by care, as I feel it must go on to be,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.26'>26</span>more and more. I am always in dread of a
quarrel with one neighbour or another; and more
than ever now, in the high fishing season.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely he has less care now than at other
times,” observed the widow. “There is just
now abundance for every body.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True; but this is the time for revenge. If
Fergus has carried himself high towards any
neighbour, or given the sharp words that are
never forgotten, now is the time for his nets to
be cut, or his boat set adrift, or what he has
fished in the day carried off in the night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are those in Garveloch, I know,”
said Katie, “who can bring themselves to do
such things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us mention no names, Katie; but thus
it is that men shame their race, and spurn the
gifts they little deserve. To think that we
cannot enjoy a plentiful season in peace and
thankfulness, but that some must injure, and
others complain! These are times when we
should leave it to the osprey to follow a prey,
and to the summer storms to murmur. Hark!
there is Angus’s step outside; and time it is,
for it cannot be far from midnight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The widow invited Angus in to warm himself
by her now bright fire; but it was time for rest.
Kenneth had gone home an hour before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He would find supper on the board,” said
Ella; “and now, Angus, you will be glad to do
the same.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Katie promised the nets within three days;
and as soon as she had closed the door behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.27'>27</span>her guests, sat down again for one other hour to
help the fulfilment of her promise, and then slept
all the better for having watched till the wind
went down.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span> <br /> <br /> KINDRED NOT KINDNESS</h3>

<p class='c015'>It was not very long before Ella’s fears on
account of her brother Fergus were in part
realized, though the evil day was deferred by an
arrangement offered by Angus and eagerly accepted
by his brother-in-law. The herring
fishery being peculiarly abundant this year,
Angus wanted more help on board his vessel;
and as it was expected that the cod would be
plentiful in proportion, Angus might in his turn
assist Fergus, when the herring shoals were
past, and the cod which follow to make prey of
them should become the chief object of the
fishery. Fergus laboured from July to October
for a certain share of the herring produce; and
Angus was to go out with Fergus in all the intervals
of his coasting trips during the late
autumn and winter. While Fergus was on board
Angus’s vessel, all went well; for Angus had
no enemies. He might spread his nets to dry
on the beach, and his youngest child was guard
enough to set over them. He never left his fish
on board all night, while he was at home, thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.28'>28</span>it wrong to put such a temptation to theft in
the way of any one; but if he had, no harm
would have been done out of malice to himself,
as was too frequently the practice in this fishery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Poor Fergus was not so secure, as he had
found before, and was destined to find again.
Like most men of hasty tempers, who are besides
subject to care, he had enemies among those
who did not know how to make allowance for
him, and were not disposed to forgive harsh expressions
which the offender was apt to forget
that he had used. Dan, easy and content as he
seemed to be, had the selfishness common to
lazy people; and there is no more inveterate
enemy to good-will than selfishness. Dan was
not, like many of his countrymen, ready with
his oaths and his cudgel at a moment’s warning,
if anything went amiss; but Dan could drawl
out the most provoking things imaginable, and
enjoy their effect upon an irritable person, and
show that he enjoyed it; and having thus encouraged
a quarrel, in which he did not give his
adversary the satisfaction of bearing his share
heartily, he let it drop; but had no objection to
see it carried on by somebody else. He amused
himself with watching what befel Fergus, and
with laughing at every little distress which arose
subsequent to a certain dispute which had once
occurred between them. He did no harm with
his own hands, but people knew that he did not
object to seeing it done; and such sympathy
affords great advantage to the doers of mischief.
Among these was Rob Murdoch, a doer of mischief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.29'>29</span>by nature as some said,—at all events by
habit, and very often by express will. Rob had
never felt at ease with Ella or any of the family
since the day of his upsetting the boat; though
there was never a look or word from any of
them which could have made him uncomfortable,
if his own consciousness had not. He was
always ready to suppose offence, and found no
difficulty in creating it where he was not liked,
and only tolerated on account of long neighbourhood
and distant relationship. He kept out
of Ella’s way, for he was mightily afraid of her.
He hated Angus, having been formerly taught
by his father that Angus was a traitor who intended
to supplant him, and the impression remained
on his stupid mind long after the cause
had been removed. Ronald was out of his way
entirely; and Fergus was therefore the only one
exposed to his poor spite, while he was the one
least able to disregard it. The time had been
when Fergus would have scorned the idea of
being moved by anything Rob could say; but
Fergus was more easily moved than formerly,
and it stung him to hear Rob predict, as he
lounged on the shore, that the wind would be
contrary when Fergus wished it fair; to be met
on his return from an unsuccessful expedition
with the news that everybody else had caught a
vast deal of fish; and, above all, to see the
enemy fretting the children into a passion, which
was a frequent pastime of Rob’s when he had
nothing better to do. Out of these provocations
arose quarrels; and out of quarrels, Rob’s desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.30'>30</span>of revenge; a desire which he could gratify
only in a small way as long as Fergus worked
for his brother-in-law. Rob asked several times
for the loan of Fergus’s boat during the herring
season; and as he made the request in his
father’s name, it was not refused; but when it
was found that the boat received some injury
each time, Fergus very reasonably desired Rob
to repair the mischief as often as he caused it.
Being too lazy to do this, the loan was denied to
him, and then he made bold to use the boat
without leave when he knew that Fergus was
absent; and the exclamations of the children
having brought their mother out to see what was
the matter, the ill-will was not lessened by the
addition of a woman’s tongue. No terms were
kept after the railing bout between Rob and
Janet on the sands: they regarded and acted
towards each other as enemies from that day
forward.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus offered Fergus a benefit, as he called
it, to finish off the season with; that is, all the
fish caught in the last trip were to be Fergus’s;
and to the winnings of this trip he looked for the
means of finally making up his rent, and of improving
the clothing of the children before the
winter. The signs of the weather were anxiously
watched by himself and his family, the nets
were carefully repaired, the casks looked to,
more salt brought in from the station, and every
preparation completed the evening before, when
the nets and stores were carried on board, and
all made ready for starting at dawn. It was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.31'>31</span>misty morning, such as would not have tempted
either Janet or Ella abroad if this had been any
other trip than the last of the season: but as it
was, they attended their husbands down to the
shore, with their children flocking about them.
As it was too foggy to let them see the vessel
at fifty yards distance from the beach they presently
returned, walking so slowly, that before
they reached home the mists had partly dispersed
at the appearance of the rising sun, and opened
a prospect along the shore.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s Rob turning the point,” cried one of
the little ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rob at this time of the morning? Impossible!”
said Ella. “They that have no more to
do than he are not stirring so early. It is he,
however. Look, Janet, how he peeps at us from
behind the rock! I will go and speak with him,
for he has no quarrel with me, and I do not
forget we are cousins.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not so easy, however, to catch him.
When he saw Ella approaching, he withdrew
from sight; and when she turned the point, he
was already high up among the rocks, on a
path which he could not have reached without
exercising more activity than was his wont.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe the man thinks,” said Ella to herself,
“as Mr. Callum used to do, that I am a
witch, for he flees me as a fowl flees the hawk.
If I could but win his ear for half an hour, there
might be an end of this ill-will between him and
Fergus, which is a scandal to relations, and to
those who, living far from war, ought to live in
peace.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.32'>32</span>Where enmity once creeps in, it is difficult to
preserve peace with any of the parties concerned.
After having missed Rob, Ella found that Janet
was offended at her having sought him; and it
was with some difficulty that she brought her
sister-in-law to acknowledge that a quarrel has
done quite enough mischief when it separates
two families, and that no advantage can arise
from its involving a third.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before many hours had elapsed, the children
came running to their mother, crying—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The boat! the boat! She is warping into
the Bay. Father will be on shore presently.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It cannot be our boat!” said Ella, turning
pale, however, as she spoke. “It must be one
of the station boats.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A glance showed her that it was indeed her
husband’s vessel coming in already, instead of
three or four days hence, as she had expected.
Her only way of accounting for this quick return
was by supposing that some accident had happened
on board. The wind was contrary, so
that it must be some time before the crew could
land, and Ella was not disposed to wait for
tidings. She commanded her children not to go
out and tell Janet, who, being busy within doors,
might not know of the return; and then went
down to the place where Murdoch’s old boat was
lying, obtained a hasty leave to use it and help
to launch it, seized the oars and pushed off, and
was presently alongside her husband’s vessel.
Fergus was already half over the side, ready to
jump down to his sister, and impatient to gain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.33'>33</span>the shore, while Angus in vain attempted to hold
him back.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Push off, Ella!” cried Angus. “Do not
come near till I bring him to reason.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Seeing that her husband and brother were
both safe, Ella repressed her anxiety to know
what had happened, and by one vigorous pull
shot off out of Fergus’s reach. He threw himself
back into the vessel, and trod the little deck
like one in a towering passion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My husband! my brother!” cried Ella, in
a tone which reached the hearts of both, “you
have not quarrelled?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O no! nor ever shall,” said Angus, laying
his hand on Fergus’s shoulder, “and least of all
this day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you think I could fall out with Angus?”
said Fergus. “No! I must be sunk indeed
before I could do that. It is he who has kept
me from ruin till now, and it is he who would
make me think I am not ruined to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ruined!—The truth was soon told. Fergus’s
nets were destroyed. They had been safe the
night before. This morning, when he was preparing
to throw them, he found them cut almost
to shreds. If he had had money to buy more, they
could not be provided in time. The season was
over; his benefit was lost; and with it went all
hopes of making up his rent by the day it would
become due, and of supplying the additions he
had proposed to the comforts of his little ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella’s suspicions lighted upon Rob even before
she heard Fergus declare that it could be nobody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.34'>34</span>else. A sudden thought having struck her, she
came alongside once more, and having communicated
with her husband in a tone which Fergus
could not overhear, she again departed, shaping
her course for Murdoch’s dwelling.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rob was lying on the beach asleep, as she expected;
and beside him was Dan, also asleep. If
they had been awake, they would not have seen
Angus’s vessel which was now behind the point to
their right. Ella stepped on shore and wakened
Rob, saying,</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see you have no business of your own this
bright noon, Rob; so come and take an oar with
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rob started up when he saw who was standing
over him. He wished his tall cousin far
over seas, or anywhere but at his elbow.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ask Dan,” said he. “Dan! here’s my cousin
Ella wants a trip. Take an oar with her, will
ye?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” replied Ella. “Let Dan finish his
dream.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Meg is stouter than I at the oar,” pleaded
Rob.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is you that I want, and that this moment,”
said Ella, pointing his way to the boat, towards
which Rob shuffled unwillingly, like a school-boy
going in search of the rod with which he is to be
whipped.</p>

<p class='c001'>Instead of giving him an oar, Ella took both;
and as he sat opposite her with nothing to do,
he felt very silly, and this feeling was a bad
preparation for what was to follow. When they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.35'>35</span>were fairly beyond the breakers, Ella rested on
her oars, and, looking her companion full in the
face, asked him where he had passed the previous
night. Rob looked up to the sky, back to the
shore, and around upon the waters, and then
scratching his head, asked,</p>

<p class='c001'>“What was that ye said, cousin Ella?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You heard what I said.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well; where should I have passed the night?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is for you to answer. I ask again
where you were when the moon set last night?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rob shuffled in his talk as well as in his gait.
He told how he oftentimes spent his time on the
rocks rather than bear the smell of putrid fish
under his father’s roof; and how Meg had foretold
a bad night, and it turned out fine; and
many other things that had nothing to do with
Ella’s question. She let him go on till, by turning
the point, they came in sight of the Flora
standing south-west. She directed his attention
to it, saying that the Flora was her object. Rob
swore a deep oath and demanded to be set on
shore again, cursing himself for having come
without knowing whither he was to be taken.
Ella’s steady eye was still upon him when she
asked the reason of this sudden horror of meeting
his cousins and boarding their boat: adding,</p>

<p class='c001'>“I fancy it is not so very long since you
were on board the Flora of your own accord.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rob had sense enough to see that he only betrayed
himself by showing eagerness to get back,
and therefore held his peace till they approached
the Flora, when he hailed Angus, requesting him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.36'>36</span>to help Ella on board; and then said to his companion,</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll take the boat straight back with pleasure,
cousin, with your thanks, I suppose, to Duncan
Hogg for the use of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not yet,” said Ella; “I have more to say
to you. Now, Rob, tell me honestly whether
you were at home all last night, and here the
mischief may end; but if you will not give an
account to us, you must to the magistrate at the
station. If you are innocent you can have no
objection to clear yourself; if you are guilty,
depend upon it you will meet with more mercy
from your cousins than from a stranger who
comes to execute justice?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As sure as ever anything happens, you
always suspect me,” muttered Rob. “What
care I what happens to Fergus, or what he makes
of his benefit?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O then, you know what has happened,” observed
Ella, “and yet I have not told you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rob, finding that he only gave new occasion
of suspicion by everything he said, took refuge
in sullen silence, got on board at Ella’s command,
and sat immovably looking at the sea as they
steered for Islay, having fastened the little boat
to the stern of the Flora.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rob’s courage or obstinacy failed him when
the station became visible, the white house of
Mr. M’Kenzie, the magistrate, appearing at some
little distance above and behind the pier, the
cooperage, the curing house and the village.
Ella, who watched an opportunity of saving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.37'>37</span>culprit from a public exposure, was by his side
the moment he showed an inclination to speak.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If ye will only just say ye are willing to
make reparation, and will never play such an unkind
prank again,” said she, “I will intercede
with Fergus to forgive you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What may be the cost of the nets?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“More than you can make up without hard
work; but it may be made up; and I would
fain set ye home, Rob, without having seen the
magistrate’s face.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rob muttered that he did not see why he
should be brought to justice more than others
that did the same trick. It was but a prank;
and when they were boys and no magistrate
within reach, nobody talked of justice.—Ella
reminded him that Mr. Callum had united all the
offices of law and justice in his own person when
the island was inhabited by few except themselves;
but that circumstances had now changed,
and relations multiplied, and that property must
be protected from the player of pranks as well
as from the thief.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fergus, touched by the kindness of his brother
and sister, controlled his passion, and received
Rob’s submission with more grace than it was
tendered with, agreeing to take compensation as
the offender should be able to give it, provided
nets could be obtained at the station on promise
of future payment.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3.38'>38</span>
  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span> <br /> <br /> LOOKING BEFORE AND AFTER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>None of the party left the station without having
seen the face of the magistrate. He was in the
store-house when Fergus went to make his application
for nets.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What makes you want so many feet of netting
at once?” asked Mr. Mackenzie; “and in
such a hurry too. I hope yours have not been
destroyed?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed but they have, your honour; and
another such loss would destroy me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The law must be put in force in its utmost
rigour,” declared the magistrate;—whereupon
Rob hastily withdrew to the cooperage, where
he might be out of sight. “Scarcely a day
passes,” continued Mr. Mackenzie, “without
information of some act of violence or another.
How do you suppose this happens, Mr. Angus?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Through jealousy, I believe, sir. We seldom
hear of thefts——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Angus. I have had
several complaints within a few days of depredations
on the fishing grounds in the lochs where
the cod are just showing themselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I rather think even these thefts must arise
from revenge more than from a desire of gain;
for there is or ought to be no want at present
through the whole extent of the fishery. Some,
like my brother Fergus, are reduced to difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.39'>39</span>by the destruction of their implements; but in
such a season as this, there can be no absolute
distress for any who are willing to work.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I scarcely know which is the most painful,”
replied the magistrate; “to see men snatching
bread out of one another’s mouths through jealousy
and spite, or under the impulse of pressing
want. The worst of it is, the last usually follows
the first. This enemy of your brother’s, who has
been injuring him now without a pretence, may
plead starvation in excuse for some other act of
violence hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I trust you are mistaken, sir,” replied Angus.
“I trust the miseries of poverty that I have seen
elsewhere are far from our shores.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The first sign of their approach, Angus, is
when men begin to fancy their interests opposed
to each other,—which the interests of men in
society can never be. Fair competition leads to
the improvement of the state of all; but the
jealousy which tempts to injure any interest
whatever is the infallible token that distress is at
hand. You have seen enough of the world to
know this to be a general truth, Angus. Why
do you dispute it in the present case?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps my own interest in the issue blinds
me,” returned Angus. “I have seen enough in
other countries of what you describe to make me
melancholy when I witness men pulling one
another’s fortunes to pieces instead of building
up the prosperity of the whole by labouring
together at that of every part. Whether I hear
of different classes in a commercial country petitioning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.40'>40</span>for impediments to be thrown in one another’s
way, or see (as I saw in Canada) jealous
neighbours levelling one another’s fences in the
dark, or laying siege to them in the day-time, I
feel sure that destruction is ready to step in and
beggar them all, whether it be in the shape of a
prohibitory duty imposed by government, or of
wild cattle that come to trample down the corn
on which the quarrellers depend.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You once told us of some who united to
make a road,” said Ella, who had now joined her
husband. “That was wiser than pulling down
fences.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where all helped to give each other the fair
advantage of a road,” replied her husband, “a
flourishing settlement presently arose among the
fertile fields. Where the fences were levelled,
there was soon no need of fences. Some who
had dwelt within them lay under the sod, hunger
having cut short their days, and others were gone
in search of food, leaving their fields to grow into
a wilderness once more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Theirs was indeed the lowest degree of folly
that can be conceived.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not quite,” observed Mr. Mackenzie. “I
can fancy a lower, though I do not ask you to
receive it as fact. This letting in of wild cattle
to trample the corn took place when but few
wanted to be fed, and those few had immediate
resources. If, instead of this act of folly, the
perpetrators had waited till hundreds and thousands
were in expectation, with an appetite which
the most ample harvests could not satisfy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.41'>41</span>had set fire to the produce at the very season
when it was most wanted, under the idea of
vexing the holders of the land, what would you
say then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is nothing to be said, sir, but that
such would be an act of mere madness,—too
evidently madness to be committed by more than
an individual, and that individual an escaped
maniac.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The school of ignorance is the innermost court
of Bedlam,” replied Mr. Mackenzie; “and while
there are any patients remaining in it, it is possible
that corn-stacks may be burned by discontented
people with the notion of revenging the wrongs
of the starving. But I put it only as a possibility,
you know.—Can it be, Angus, that you do not
see the tendency of the acts of violence that are
disturbing this very district? Do you not see
distress and ruin in full prospect if they are not
checked, and if, moreover, the temper of the
people be not directly reversed?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our resources are so improved that I would
fain hope the best; and yet our numbers increase
in full proportion, so that we had not
need waste any of our capital.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think not indeed. I have been visiting
every station on the coast and in the islands, and
I find the same state of things everywhere,—a
prosperity so unusual in these districts, that
the people think their fortune secure for ever,
while they are hastening, by every possible means,
the approach of distress.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope you find the farms and pastures improving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.42'>42</span>with the fishery?” observed Angus.—“Everything
depends upon the food keeping
pace with the employment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The farms are improving to the utmost that
skill and labour can make them improve. There
is the powerful stimulus of an increasing demand,
while there are increasing facilities of
production. There is more manure, there are
better implements, and more cattle; so that
some farms produce actually double what they
did when the fishery began.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus shook his head, observing that this
was not enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They have done their best already in the
way of increase,” said he. “They may be improved
for some time to come, and to a great
degree; but each improvement yields a less return:
so that they will be further and further
perpetually from again producing double in ten
years; and all this time the consumers are increasing
at a much quicker rate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not double in ten years surely?” said Ella.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not; but say twenty, thirty, fifty,
a hundred, any number of years you choose;—still,
as the number of people doubles itself for
ever, while the produce of the land does not, the
people must increase faster than the produce. If
corn produced corn without being wedded to the
soil, the rate of increase might be the same with
that of the human race. Then two sacks of
barley might grow out of one, and two more
again out of each of those two—proceeding from
one to two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four,
and so on.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.43'>43</span>“If capital could be made to increase in this
way, I see, Angus, that there could never be too
many people in the world, or in our little world,
Garveloch.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or if, on the other hand, human production
could be kept down to the same rate with the
production of our fields, we need have no fear
of a deficiency of food. If the number of producers
increased only in proportion to the increase
of food, there would be no distress of the
kind our islands were formerly afflicted with, and
may be afflicted with again. But nobody thinks
of establishing such a proportion; and in the
meanwhile, food is yielded, though in larger
quantities, in less and less proportions, while the
eaters go on doubling and doubling their numbers
perpetually.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then, to be sure, it is madness to destroy
one another’s means of living,” cried Ella. “It
seems the first duty of everybody to increase the
production of food; and yet, here we are, cutting
one another’s nets to pieces, and driving the fish
away on which we depend for our subsistence!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not wonder now,” said Mr. Mackenzie,
“at my grief for the ignorance of the
people, and my disgust at the quarrels that have
such consequences. I assure you the season is
actually lost in some of the northern lochs; for,
not only are some fishers left without nets or
lines, but the fish have made no stay, being
alarmed by tumult; and it is but too probable
that they will not return.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And all this time,” continued Angus, “these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.44'>44</span>very quarrellers go on marrying early, and raising
large families—that is, they bring offspring into
the world while they are providing as fast as
possible for their future starvation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is no need to do here as the Romans
did,” said Mr. Mackenzie, “and as many other
nations have done—no need to offer bounties for
the increase of population.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think not indeed,” said Ella. “It seems
a thing to be checked, rather than encouraged.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All depends on time and circumstances,
Ella. When Noah and his little tribe stepped
out of the ark into a desolated world, the great
object was to increase the number of beings,
who might gather and enjoy the fruits which the
earth yielded, in an abundance overpowering to
the few who were there to consume. And the
case is the same with every infant nation which
is not savage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Savages do not value or subsist upon the
fruits of the earth so much as upon the beasts of
the field,” said Ella;—“at least so Angus told
me of those who have retreated from before us in
America.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Savages care for little beyond supplying the
pressing wants of the moment,” replied Angus.
“They make no savings; they have no capital;
and their children die off as fast as poverty and
disease can drive them out of the world. There
is no growth of either capital or population
among savages.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Those have indeed a poor chance for life
and health,” said Mr. Mackenzie, “whose parents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.45'>45</span>feed at the best on raw roots and berries,
who sometimes keep themselves alive by swallowing
grubs and worms, and at other times fast for
a week together. Shrunk, deformed, and weakly
themselves, their offspring are little likely to survive
a scarcity, even if it were possible to rear
them under the most favourable circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is absurd,” said Angus, “to doubt the rate
at which the human race increases on account
of the decrease of numbers among savages.
The whole question is concerning the proportion
which capital and population bear to each other;
and it cannot therefore be tried where no capital
exists.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose,” observed Ella, “that flocks and
herds are the first capital which a tribe possesses
in any large quantity. How do numbers increase
among people who seek pasture but do
not till the ground?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such tribes are most numerous where pastures
are fine, and weak where the natural produce
of the earth is scanty. But each continues
a tribe, and cannot become a nation while following
a pastoral life. Their flocks cannot multiply
beyond a certain point unless the food of
the flocks is increased; and they who subsist
upon the flocks cannot, in like manner, multiply
beyond a certain point, unless the flocks on
which they feed are multiplied.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But they not only do not increase,” observed
Mr. Mackenzie, “they are lessened perpetually
by one or another of the unfortunate
accidents to which their condition subjects them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.46'>46</span>Pastoral tribes are particularly prone to war.
Instead of keeping possession of a certain territory
on which they always dwell, they rove
about from one tract of country to another,
leaving undefended some which they call their
own;—another tribe takes possession; and then
comes a struggle and a destructive war, which
reduces their numbers. Many of these tribes
live in a state of continual hostility, and therefore
dwindle away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But when they begin to settle and till the
ground,” said Ella, “I suppose their numbers
increase again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; the Jews, after they were established
in Canaan, became an agricultural nation, and
multiplied very rapidly. It was made, both by
their laws and customs, a point of duty to marry
and to marry young; and when the check of
war was removed, their small territory became
very thickly peopled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose it was to repair the waste of war,”
said Ella, “that the bounty on population was
offered among the Romans.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not only from this cause,” replied Mr.
Mackenzie, “but to repair the breaches made
in other ways. In the early days of Rome, the
population was too large for the capital in intervals
of peace, as appears from the law of their
king Romulus, that no child should be exposed
to die in the desert before three years of age—a
proof that it had been the previous practice to
expose children under that age. In after times—in
the days of Roman glory—the population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.47'>47</span>was apt to decrease, even in times of peace,
from the faults in the distribution of property.
The land had fallen into the hands of a few great
proprietors, and was not tilled by free labour.
Swarms of slaves were brought in from all conquered
countries, and they alone were employed
where free labour should have claimed a share
of labour and reward; and there was therefore
no subsistence for a middling and lower class of
free people. Their numbers dwindled so as to
alarm their rulers and give occasion to express
laws for the encouragement of population. If,
instead of passing laws to promote early marriages,
and offering privileges to those who had
a certain number of children, the Roman emperors
had allowed liberty to the people they
governed to labour and subsist, there would have
been no complaint of a deficiency of numbers,
but rather an inquiry, as there is among us, how
all that are born are to be fed?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But do you mean, sir,” said Angus, “that
there were not children born to the lower classes
of the Romans, or that they were born and died
through want?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Multitudes that were born died immediately,
from being exposed; and besides this, marriage
was less practised during these ages of the Roman
empire than among the same number of
people in any other country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The laws were not of much use then.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how can we wonder, when it was actually
the custom to give away corn gratis to thousands
upon thousands who had no means of earning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.48'>48</span>it! What inducement has a man to marry, when
he must either expose his children, or see them
die at home, or take his chance of a gratuitous
dole of food for them? The laws, if they acted
at all, would not act upon these large classes,
but upon those of a higher rank, who would
marry if there were no law.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If in any country,” observed Ella, “there
are no laws to encourage or to check marriage,
it seems as if that country ought to afford a fair
example of the natural increase of numbers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” said her husband, “human laws have
little influence in this case, while the natural laws
which regulate the production of life and of
capital are seldom suffered to act unchecked.
Leave the people of any country as free as you
please to marry or not as they like, still, if
capital is controlled in any way, the population is
controlled also.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where then,” inquired Ella, “does capital
act the most freely? Where in the world may
we see an example of the natural proportions in
which men and subsistence increase?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There has never been an age or country
known,” replied Mr. Mackenzie, “where at once
the people have been so intelligent, their manners
so pure, and their resources so abundant, as to
give the principle of increase an unobstructed
trial. Savage life will not do, because the people
are not intelligent. Colonies will not do, because
they are not free from vicious customs.
An old empire will not do, because the means of
subsistence are restricted.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.49'>49</span>“A new colony of free and intelligent people
in a fertile country affords the nearest approach
to a fair trial,” observed Angus. “In some of
the best settlements I saw in America, the increase
of capital and of people went on at a rate
that would scarcely be believed in an old country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And that of the people the fastest, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course; but still capital was far a-head,
though the population is gaining upon it every
year. When the people first went, they found
nothing but capital—all means of production
and no consumers but themselves. They raised
corn in the same quantity from certain fields
every year. There was too much corn at first
in one field for a hundred mouths; but this hundred
became two, four, eight, sixteen hundred,
and so on, till more and more land was tilled,
the people still spreading over it, and multiplying
perpetually.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And when all is tilled and they still multiply,”
said Ella, “they must improve their land
more and more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And still,” said Angus, “the produce will
fall behind more and more, as every improvement,
every outlay of capital yields a less return.
Then they will be in the condition of an old
country like England, where many are but half
fed, where many prudent determine not to marry,
and where the imprudent must see their children
pine in hunger, or waste under disease till they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.50'>50</span>are ready to be carried off by the first attack of
illness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“May this never be the case in Garveloch!”
cried Ella.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The more waste of capital there is,” said
Mr. Mackenzie, “the sooner will that day come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But our islands are now in the state of a
new colony, like that Angus was speaking of,”
said Ella. “Want must be far from us at present.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Except that we have not a fertile soil or a
good climate,” replied her husband. “It is
true we do not depend entirely on corn;—we
had not need for our home supply can never be
large. We have the resource of fish, but it is
so precarious a resource, that we ought to keep
some means of subsistence in reserve. If the
herrings should desert us for a season or two,
and the harvest fail, some of us must starve, or
all be half-starved, unless we have a stock in reserve.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor Fergus!” exclaimed Ella. “No
wonder he was grieved and angry this morning!
Five children and no capital stored up! He
may well watch the seasons and tremble at a
storm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sorry,” observed Mr. Mackenzie, “that
he will not give up the name of the offender who
has injured him. It is necessary to the public
safety that this wanton destruction of property
should be put an end to; and I give it in charge
to you, Angus, to see that full compensation is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.51'>51</span>made, or that the culprit is delivered into my
hands to be made an example of. If it had been
generally known that I am here to administer
the law, I would not have yielded this much;
but as I have only just arrived, and am but beginning
to make known the law, I do not insist
on an information being laid this time. Henceforward
I always shall; for connivance at an
offence is itself an offence.”</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span> <br /> <br /> MORE HASTE THAN GOOD SPEED.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Fergus meanwhile was consulting Ronald as
to the best mode in which Rob’s labour could be
applied towards repairing the damage he had
caused. He was too stupid and awkward to be
entrusted with any occupation in which he would
not be overlooked by some more competent person;
and Ronald knew, though he did not say
so, that there would be perpetual danger of a
quarrel if Rob became Fergus’s assistant in fishing.
Ronald, therefore, kindly offered to give
Rob some inferior employment about the cooperage,
providing for his support out of his wages,
and paying the rest over to Fergus till the whole
debt should be cleared. Rob, to whom all labour
was disagreeable alike, sulkily consented, and
swore at himself and everybody else when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.52'>52</span>saw the Flora clear out from the little harbour,
and leave him behind to repair by the labour of
weeks and months the mischief he had done in
two short hours. He had not only the cost of
the nets to pay, but the amount which Fergus
would have cleared by the benefit he was now
prevented from taking.</p>

<p class='c001'>While he was involuntarily saving during this
winter, his neighbours in Garveloch were going
on as variously as might be expected from the
difference in their knowledge, in their desires,
and in their habits. The Company was prosperous
in a very high degree, and so, therefore,
might their labourers of every rank have been;
but in this society, as in all, some were wise and
some were foolish; some provided for a time of
darkness, and some did not.</p>

<p class='c001'>None were more provident than Angus and
Ella, or provident in a wiser manner. Seeing
so clearly as they did the importance of an increase
of capital in a society which was adding
to its numbers every day, they reflected and consulted
much on the modes and rates of increase
of capital differently applied, and saw that the
interest of the Company, and of every individual
employed by it, was one and the same. Since
capital grows from savings only, there seemed
no hope that that of the Company should keep
pace with the demands upon it; but something
might be done by increasing the value of the
capital,—by making it secure, by lessening the
attendant expenses, by using every possible method
of making production easy and rapid. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.53'>53</span>all the corn that was raised in the islands
had been used for seed-corn, instead of nine-tenths
of it being eaten; if all the fish had been
turned into its market-price on the spot, without
any expense of curing, packing, and conveying,
this capital would still have doubled itself much
more slowly than the number of people who were
to subsist upon it; and when their subsistence
and all attendant expenses were subtracted, the
process became much slower. Yet it was a favourable
time and a favourable set of circumstances
for capital to grow in. The property
was secure, being under the protection of law
well administered, and under the management
of an united body of directors. The expenses
were small, the position of the different stations
being advantageous, and the required apparatus
very simple. Production was at the same time
easy; for the herrings came regularly, and the
seasons had thus far been favourable. Here,
then, capital might grow, if ever or anywhere;
and it did grow; but the demands upon it grew
still faster; and therefore Angus and Ella guarded
the capital of their employers as if it had been
their own, while they added to their private store
as fast as was consistent with a due enjoyment
of the fruits of their labour. Though they had
nine children, they were at present in more favourable
circumstances for saving than some of
their neighbours who had few or none. Dan
and his Noreen, for instance, saved nothing;
how should they, when their hut scarcely protected
them from the rain and snow, or their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.54'>54</span>clothing from the chilling winds,—when there
was not even the slightest preparation made for
the tender little one that was soon to come into
their charge? There can be no saving expected
from those whose commonest wants are not supplied.
The Murdochs were in nearly as poor a
condition; and since they had never managed to
avoid sinking, even in their best days, it was
scarcely likely that they should now. Fergus
toiled and toiled, and just continued to keep his
place in the little society, but he could do no
more. The consumption of his family just
equalled the supply afforded by his labour, so
that he could not, with all his efforts, set apart
anything to begin saving upon. His nest-egg
(whenever he thought he had one) had always
disappeared before the day was out. There was
nothing for it, but hoping that good seasons and
full employment would last till his boys’ labour
should more than equal their consumption, and
should not only release him from the charge of
their maintenance, but assist in the support of
the little ones, who must be nearly helpless for
years to come.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this society had been constituted like that
of Rome, of which we have spoken, there would
have been little or no saving, and therefore no
provision for an increase in the number of its
members. Where society is composed of a few
very rich people and a multitude very poor, the
least saving of all is made. The rich only <em>can</em>
save in such a case, and they do not perceive a
sufficient motive for doing so. They reckon on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.55'>55</span>being always rich, and do not see why they should
not enjoy their wealth to the utmost, year by
year. Where society is composed of a few moderately
rich and many sufficiently supplied with
necessaries, there is a much better chance of an
accumulation of capital, since the majority of the
people have then a hope of raising their children
to the rank of the moderately rich. They are
free from the recklessness of the miserably poor,
and from the thoughtless extravagance of the
possessors of overgrown wealth. To this middling
class belonged Angus, the widow Cuthbert,
Ronald and the Duffs; and they therefore made
the largest savings in proportion to their earnings.
Mr. Mackenzie spent all his income, having no
children, and feeling himself provided for for life.
The naval superintendent, captain Forbes, a
spirited young officer, was so far from attempting
to save, that he flung his money about during
his flying visits to the stations till he had none
left, and barely escaped debt. But Duff, who
was not placed beyond the danger of bad seasons,
widow Cuthbert, and Angus, who had children
dependent on them, and Ronald, who regarded
the families of Ella and Fergus with strong
affection, had motives to save, and did their full
share towards making the capital of the society
grow.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day the next spring, Ronald appeared
before his sister’s door.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Welcome, brother!” exclaimed Ella. “Is
it a leisure day with you? and are you come to
spend it with us?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.56'>56</span>“It is a leisure day, and the last I shall have
for long; and I am come to tell you why, and
to consult with Angus about a little business of
his. This is the reason that I came myself instead
of sending Kenneth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I began to think you never meant to come,
you have been so considerate in sparing Kenneth.
But sit ye down,—aye, outside the door
if you like, for it is a true spring day,—and Angus
will be up from the boat presently.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus was soon seen hastening to meet Ronald,
who then told his news. Captain Forbes
had arrived at the islay station in high spirits.
A new market for their produce was unexpectedly
opened in the West Indies. It was his belief
that all the fish they could possibly prepare
during the season would be insufficient to meet
the sudden demand; and he came to see how
many boats could be mustered, and how many
labourers could be withdrawn from other employments
to aid in the fishery.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now is Fergus’s time,” said Ella, “for getting
his two boys hired at the station. They are
young, to be sure; but as so many labourers are
wanted, their services will be received, I dare
say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now is Rob’s time for clearing off his debt
to Fergus,” observed Angus; “for I suppose,
Ronald, wages will rise at the cooperage. More
barrels will be wanted than you can easily prepare.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt,” replied Ronald. “Now is your
time, Angus, for building the platform you were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.57'>57</span>talking of last year; and I came to offer what
help I can. I will spare Kenneth for a week
now to work with you; and I give you notice
that you must take him now or not at all. And
if there should be any difficulty about the little
capital wanted for the work, I have a few pounds
which are much at your service.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus thankfully accepted the offer of his
boy’s help, but had no occasion to borrow money.
He should lose no time, he said, in erecting his
platform, if the tidings Ronald brought should
prove correct. Much time and labour in lading
and unlading his vessel might be economized by
the employment of a crane; and he thought he
could not invest his savings better than in
making such a provision at the commencement
of a busier season than had ever been known in
Garveloch.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella’s apprehension was that the demand would
be only temporary. On this head Ronald could
give her no satisfaction, as he did not know
enough of the circumstances to judge: but he
thought that all who were called upon to use
only their labour, or a small capital which yields
a quick return, might rejoice in this sudden prosperity
without any fear of consequences; and
even Angus’s investment of fixed capital would
be perfectly safe. If it was doubtful the year
before whether the erection of a platform and
crane would not be worth while, it could scarcely
fail to answer now, when there was to be a large
addition to the profits of an ordinary season,
even if that addition should be only temporary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.58'>58</span>Angus proposed going to the spot to take measurements,
and make an estimate of the expense.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you will wait till noon is past,” said Ella,
“I can go with you. I must be taught your
plan, Angus, that I may answer for you when
you are absent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another object in this delay was to set her
brother at liberty to go where she knew his heart
was all this time. While she was finishing her
household business, uncle Ronald went down with
some of the little ones to launch a tiny boat,—a
present from Kenneth,—in one of the pools
on the beach. Their mother heard their shouts
of glee, and thought within herself that there
were no festival days like those when her brother
or her boy came from the station.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a few minutes the children were playing
without their uncle’s assistance. He had gone
to the widow Cuthbert’s. Katie frankly held
out her hand as he entered, and bade him welcome
to Garveloch. She was just spreading the
table for dinner, and invited him to sit down
with herself and the children: but when he declined,
she made no ceremony, but called the
little ones from their play; and the meal went
forward as if no guest had been there, except
that Katie conversed freely with her friend Ronald.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hugh is much grown,” observed Ronald.
“I did not know him at first when he came to
see me land.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I knew you though,” cried Hugh, “and I
went to see whether you brought me a tub like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.59'>59</span>the one you gave Bessie. I want a tub for my
fish when I catch any.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will make you a tub bigger than Bessie’s,
and Kenneth shall bring it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish you would bring it,” cried Hugh.
“You promised me a boat the last time you
came, a long, long while ago, and you never
sent it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, indeed I did, Hugh, and I thought
Kenneth had given it to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Katie explained that it had been delivered
safe, but had strangely disappeared before Hugh
had seen it; and that as he never asked about it,
she had not vexed him with explaining what had
happened.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why did not you ask me for another?” said
Ronald. “I do wish you would be free with me
as an old friend.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed I always am,” replied Katie. “I
would ask a favour of you as easily as of Angus
or Fergus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After a moment’s pause, Ronald told his tidings
of the prospect of a busy season, and offered to
purchase hemp for the widow and send it by
Kenneth, before the price should rise, if she
had not already a sufficient stock for her net-making
for the year. Katie thankfully accepted
his services, and looked so cheerfully round upon
her children, when she heard of the approaching
prosperity, that Ronald was glad he had taken
courage to come and tell her.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the meal was over, Katie took up her
employment and seemed far from wishing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.60'>60</span>Ronald should go; but she kept little Hugh
beside her to show Ronald how he was learning
to help his mother in her work.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the time several subjects of mutual interest
had been talked over, Ronald recollected that the
hour was long past when he ought to have met
Angus on the beach, and he rose to go, offering
to look in again in the evening before his departure;
to which Katie made no objection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dinner was over at Angus’s house, but Ella,
who guessed where her brother was, would not
have him called.—She suspected the truth,—that
he came to observe whether there was any
chance of his winning Katie at last, and to consult
his sister, in case of being unable to discover
for himself how Katie felt towards him. He was
rather disheartened by the interview. She was
so frank and friendly in her manner that he could
not believe she felt any of the restraint he
laboured under—anything more than the regard
which she testified to his sister and brother.
Ella could not contradict him. She was far from
thinking the case a hopeless one; but she believed
that time and patience were still and would long
be necessary. She assured her brother that precipitation
would probably ruin all; and that his
best chance was in quietly waiting till he should
have further opportunities of winning upon her.
This determined Ronald not to speak at present,
as, in his impatience of suspense, he had nearly
resolved to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the little party went down to the place
where Angus proposed to erect his new building,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.61'>61</span>several loungers gathered round to watch what
was going to be done. Ronald was looked upon
as so awfully learned a man, especially when
using his rule and frowning over his calculations,
that strangers,—such strangers as were in Garveloch,—did
not venture to speak to him. They
made their inquiries of the children in preference.</p>

<p class='c001'>First came Noreen lagging along the shore in
the gray cloak which she was supposed never to
put off, as she had never been seen without it,
winter or summer. Wrapt in it, and hanging
over her arm, head downwards, was her baby,
feebly crying, as usual, and as usual disregarded;
for nothing short of a shrill scream seemed to
be thought by Noreen worthy of attention. Her
cap was nearly the same colour as her cloak, and
her hair did not tend to ornament her further
than by helping to conceal a black eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Annie, darling, and how busy you all seem!
And you nursing the babby as if you’d had one in
your arms all your days, my darling.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I dare not hold him as you hold your’s,”
said Annie. “Look! the little thing’s face is as
black——O look!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As black as your eye,” cried Bessie.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it my eye, darling? O, it’s a trifle that
Dan gave me,—the villain,—when the spirits
were in him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! did Dan strike you?” cried Annie,
who was old enough to know that husbands and
wives should not fall out like children.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Strike me, darling! Yes, and the babby too.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.62'>62</span>O, you should have heard the babby bawl as loud
as me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is not Dan very sorry?” asked Annie,
coaxing the unfortunate infant.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it sorry the ruffian would be? Not he;
and why should he? ’Twas the spirits that made
him a villain for the time; but he is the mildest
husband of a noon-time that ever was seen. So,
darling, don’t you go and dream he isn’t a good
enough man for me. Heaven’s blessing on
him!—He never bothers me as your father
would, Annie. We’re just content, without all
the measuring and building, and salting and packing,
that you have to do at the father’s bidding,
my darling. What’s all this trouble about now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Annie was too anxious to defend her father to
answer the question immediately; so Noreen
turned round to the little ones who were jumping
from the ledges of rock.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what’s all this trouble about, jewels?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The captain is coming! the captain is
coming!” cried they.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it the captain going to have a new house on
Garveloch?” cried Noreen. “O Dan, up to the
gentleman as soon as he comes, and get the money
others got before you last time; and when ye
get it, don’t be making a beast of yourself or a martyr
of the babby, but remember the rent, jewel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dan found it much easier to remember the rent
than to pay it, and had rather give his wife a
black eye in private than be lectured by her in
public; and he therefore looked sulky and bade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.63'>63</span>her run after the captain if she chose, for that he
would not bother himself for any reason in life.—Ella,
who had overheard all, explained that
there was no reason, as far as the captain was
concerned; but that if Dan would bother himself
to go out fishing, the rent would be no longer a
trouble.</p>

<p class='c001'>With all their recklessness and indolence, these
people had pride; and when they heard that everybody
was likely to prosper this summer, Noreen
began to talk of holding up her head, as she had
a right to do, equal to any of them that little
thought what her relations were at Rathmullin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dan esteemed it mighty provoking that the
bread was taken from within his teeth by them
that were born to nothing but what they got with
their dirty hands. If he had had a word with the
captain as soon as others, he might have coaxed
him into letting him have a boat; but it was
always the way,—while he was content at home
and just thinking of nothing at all, some vagabond
or another stept into his shoes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald refrained from calling Dan to account
for his term of abuse, knowing it to be in such
frequent use in Ireland as to have lost much of
its offensiveness. He assured Dan that the captain
had work for everybody just now, and urged
his making application to be hired without delay.</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch stared with astonishment when he
found that Angus was actually going to take
down his curing-shed and remove it to the place
where the stage was to be erected. It seemed
to him as well as to Dan vastly too much trouble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.64'>64</span>and expense; but Angus had taken into account
the damage the fish sustain by being much
exposed and shifted about previous to curing;
and he believed that the expedition and security
with which the produce would be hauled up, prepared,
and shipped again, would soon repay him
for what he was about to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>The business of months seemed to be transacted
in Garveloch this afternoon, on the strength of
the tidings which Ronald brought. All doubtful
matters (except the one which most nearly concerned
Ronald) were brought to a decision.
Angus decided, as we have seen, on making a
large venture of fixed capital. Farmer Duff decided
on hiring some more labourers while there
was any chance of his getting them. Fergus
decided on offering the labour of his two eldest
boys at the station, believing that there would be
work for all, however young. More than a few
parties decided that their courtship should end in
immediate marriage, and never doubted the perfect
propriety of making use of a season of prosperity
for the purpose. Dan decided on putting his
hand to the oar at last. All who wished to hire
labour decided on looking abroad for labourers,
and betimes, if they wished to make good terms.
All who had labour to let began to consider how
high they might venture to fix its price.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was no deceitful promise of prosperity,—to
those at least who did not expect too much
from it. The sanguine and the ignorant, who
are ever ready to take an ell where an inch is
given, supposed that their island was enriched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.65'>65</span>for ever. They heard of wages rising higher
and higher, and never suspected they might fall.
They saw that the only thing at present wanted
was a greater number of labourers, and imagined
that when their tribes of children were grown up,
all would be right,—wages as high, food as
plentiful as now, and as great an increase of employment
as there would be of labour. It was
well that all did not keep up their expectations
to this pitch,—that some were aware how precarious
was the present prosperity. A single bad
season, the opening of a few more fishing stations,
a change in the diet of the West India slaves,—any
one of these, or many other circumstances,
might reduce the Garveloch fishery to what it
had been; while the numbers of those who depended
upon it for subsistence were increasing
with a greater and a greater rapidity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The least sanguine, however, could not resist
the feeling of exhilaration excited by what passed
before their eyes: nor was there any reason that
they should. Prudence and foresight do not
interfere with the rational enjoyment of blessings;
they rather add to it by imparting a
feeling of security. The youngest and giddiest
could not relish more than Angus and his wife
the freedom from care they now enjoyed, the
sight of plenty around them, and the knowledge
that none need be idle, none need be poor; and
if these, the young and the giddy, bestowed
little thought on the probable issue of their
present state, and escaped the anxiety with which
they ought to have regarded the future, neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.66'>66</span>did they share the satisfaction of making provision
for a season of storms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The captain alighted in Garveloch, now and
then, in his flight round the station. He was
always in a prodigious bustle, and he made every
body he met as fidgetty as himself about the impossibility
of getting labourers enough for the
work to be done. Wherever he went, it was
suggested to him that people might be hired from
some other place, from which other place he had
just heard that there was also a deficiency of
labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some people thought they might be satisfied
with having as large a trade as their numbers
could manage; but the captain was not satisfied
without taking all that offered. Men and their
families were brought from a distance, all the
boys that could handle an oar or help to draw a
net received wages; all the girls assisted their
mothers to cure; so that, at this time, the largest
families were the richest. These circumstances
acted as an encouragement, and the captain’s
sanguine expectation that the demand would
continue operated as a direct bounty on population;
and, in consequence, numbers increased
in Garveloch as rapidly as in any new colony of
a fertile country.</p>

<p class='c001'>The seasons which are favourable to the
fishery,—in respect of weather,—are favourable
to the harvest also. Farmer Duff reaped abundant
crops the next two seasons, which unusual
abundance just served to feed his customers.
What would have been done in case of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.67'>67</span>average or an inferior crop having been yielded,
few troubled themselves to determine. They
had enough, and that was all they cared for.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth could not often be spared during
these two seasons; but he came to attend the
christening of a little brother and of two cousins.
The only troubles he had to relate were of the
difficulty of supplying the orders for barrels, and
of the passion the captain was in when fish were
spoiled for sale by being packed in old casks.
The magistrate had the least to do of anybody.
Hard times are the days of crime. There were
still occasional quarrels; complaints of oppression
on one side and sauciness on the other, and
of a few acts of malice still perpetrated by people
as stupid and helpless as Rob; but the crimes
to which men are stimulated by want were not at
present heard of. Were they over for ever?</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span> <br /> <br /> A DREARY PROSPECT.</h3>

<p class='c015'>A time of leisure, as grievous to the most
reckless and indolent as to the superior members
of the society, came round ere long. First appeared
hardship in the shape of an average crop;
for the people having increased their consumption
up to the amount of a remarkably abundant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.68'>68</span>harvest, were of course stinted when the soil
yielded only the usual return. No very disastrous
consequences followed at first. There
was much complaint and a little dismay when it
was found that supplies must not be looked for
from the neighbouring districts, since there also
the season had been only moderately favourable,
and there were mouths enough to feed in each
place to leave no supplies over for Garveloch.
The Garveloch people therefore were obliged to
eat some of their fish instead of selling it, and to
pay a very high price for their barley and oatmeal.
Those who were able to give this price
were willing to do it, seeing that the rise of price
was a necessary consequence of the comparative
scarcity; that farmer Duff must pay himself for
the outlay on his land, whether its produce were
ample or scanty; and that its dearness alone
could make the supply last till the next harvest
came round. Those who were too poor to buy
abused the farmer, saying that his crop was not
scantier than it had been in many former years
when he had sold it much cheaper, and that he
was making use of a dispensation of Providence
to fill his own pocket. They were slow to perceive
that it was themselves and not the farmer
who had made the change; that they had caused
the increase of demand and the consequent rise
of price.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would have been well if nothing worse than
the occurrence of an average season had happened.
The number of people brought by a
sudden demand for labour might have lessened.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.69'>69</span>Some might have departed elsewhere, and others
have devised plans for a new introduction or
better economy of food; and after a short period
of hardship, the demand for food might have
gradually accommodated itself to the supply; for
their society was not like the population of an
overgrown district, where there may be mistakes
in ascribing effects to causes, and where the
blame of hardship may be laid in the wrong
place. The people of Garveloch might survey
their little district at a glance, and calculate the
supply of provision grown, and count the numbers
to be fed by it, and by this means discern,
in ordinary circumstances, how they might best
manage to proportion their resources of labour
and food. But if any had endeavoured to do
this, their expectations would have been baffled
by the event, unless they had taken into the
account the probability of bad seasons—a probability
which the truly wise will never overlook.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few seasons after the period of prosperity
of which we have spoken, the dawn of a June
morning broke as gloomily as if it had been
November. Scudding clouds, from which came
gushes of hail, swept over the sky and brushed
the tallest points of rock as they passed. The
wind came in gusts as chill as the wintry blasts,
and before it the vexed ocean swelled and heaved,
while its tumbling mass of waters seemed to
forbid man to approach, much more to trust the
frail workmanship of his hands to its overwhelming
power. The night-light still glimmered from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.70'>70</span>some of the dwellings in Garveloch, the islands
of the Sound were not yet visible from the heights,
and the peaks of Lorn were but beginning to
show themselves against the eastern sky, when
Angus came out stealthily from his dwelling,
softly closed the door, drew his plaid about him,
and paced down to the beach. He was proceeding
to get out his boat, when his son Kenneth
approached.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father,” said he, “you are not going to
trust yourself at sea to-day?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Help must be had, Kenneth. I must cross
at the risk of my own life, or more will be lost.
I have here the last of my savings; and since
money is worth no more than pebbles in Garveloch,
I must carry it where it may buy us food.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And my mother——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your mother is in the inner room, where
she has been up with Jamie all night. I heard
him very loud just now. His fever runs high,
so that she will not miss me perhaps for hours.
She neither saw nor heard me come out.—Now,
Kenneth, say nothing about going instead of
me. You know that my experience of the sea
is greater than yours, and the best skill is little
enough for such a voyage as mine is like to <a id='corr70.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='be'>be.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_70.26'><ins class='correction'>be.</ins></a></span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But my mother must soon know,” urged
Kenneth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely. Tell her that I hope to be back
to-morrow night, with that which may ease her
nursing. Farewell, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth was a brave, high-spirited youth.
His heart was full when he saw his father put off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.71'>71</span>among the stormy breakers, and he therefore
said nothing. He helped to guide the boat to
the last moment, wading as deep and struggling
with the waves as long as he possibly could, till
his father made a commanding sign that he
should return. There was no use in speaking
amidst the thunder of the waters. Kenneth
wrung out his plaid, and climbing the rock, sat
down, unheeding the wind, to watch his father’s
boat, scarcely visible in the grey light, as it
won its weary way among the billows. Bitter
thoughts rose fast within him;—his father in
peril at sea; his mother worn with care and
watching; his beloved little Jamie, the youngest
of the large family, and their darling, sinking
under the fever; all the others changing from
what they had been, some in health, some in
spirits, some in temper, and he unable to do anything
to help them. Dismissed with others from
the station because his labour was not now worth
the food he consumed, he had come home to be,
as he thought, a burden, but as his parents declared,
a comfort, to his family amidst their cares,
and daily looked round, and ever in vain, for
some means of assisting them. As he now
thought of the fruitlessness of all his efforts, tears
rose and blinded him so that he could no longer
discern any object at sea. As fast as he dashed
them away they rose again, till he no longer
resisted them, but let them flow as they had never
flowed since childhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>As he sat with his face hid in his plaid, he was
roused by the pressure of his mother’s hand upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.72'>72</span>his shoulder. She had spoken from a distance,
but the roaring of wind and waters and the
screaming of sea-fowl were more powerful than
her voice, and her appearance took Kenneth by
surprise—a surprise at which she smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mother!” he cried, as he started up, and a
burning blush overspread his face; “if I were a
good son, it would be my part to smile when I
found you with sinking spirits.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella smiled again as she answered—</p>

<p class='c001'>“And when my spirits sink, I will look to
you for cheer. Meantime, never fancy that tears
are unworthy a brave man, or always a sorrowful
sight to a mother. It is God’s will, Kenneth,
that there is cause for tears; and since there is
cause, it is no pain to me to see them fall. If
God calls you and me hither to look out upon a
second year’s storms, he knows that it is as natural
for the heart as for the cloud to drop its
rain; and never think, my boy, that I shall be
a harder judge than he.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what brought ye out, mother, so early,
into the cold?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I came to seek the cooling wind. Jamie
fell asleep, and Annie came to take her turn beside
him; and finding Angus gone, and my head
hot and weary, I thought I should find more rest
on the rock than in my bed. I see the boat,
Kenneth. I know your father’s purpose, and I
guess you were praying just now for his safe
return.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, O mother! I had some distrustful
thoughts in the midst of my prayer. If he should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.73'>73</span>not return, and even while he is gone, I can do
nothing. Here I am, eating my daily portion,
which I never helped to earn; being a burden
when I thought—proud as I was—that I should
be your main joy and help. O mother! this
humbles one sadly. I never thought to be so
humbled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who that is humbled ever sees the stroke
before it comes, Kenneth? Look round, and
mark. Where many a smoke rose, only a short
year since, from those cottages below, the fires
are quenched, and with them is quenched the
pride of those who revelled in plenty. Now,
many are gone, and have left but four bare walls
for us to remember them by. Some are gone
to lie cold under yonder gray stones, and some
few have found their way back over the sea.
Those that remain have lost their pride: it was
blown away with the cold ashes of their last fire;
and it will not come back while they sit hungry
and shivering. Which of these thought any
more than you that they should be so humbled?
When I gloried in my Jamie, as the brightest
and handsomest of my children, I did not expect
that he would be the first I should lay in the
grave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Must he die, mother?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I take such to be God’s will, Kenneth; but
I once had a lesson, as you know, against reading
his pleasure too readily. They that I thought
lost came to dry land, and another lay under the
water when I thought him safe on the hard rock.
Since that day, I have ever waited for the issue;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.74'>74</span>and so I will now. We will hope that Jamie
may live, and we will be ready to part with any
who were but just now in life and strength.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is but little we know, indeed,” replied
Kenneth. “It seems but yesterday that yon sea
was almost as busy as a thronged city, with a
hundred vessels following the shoals, and then
crowding homewards with a full cargo; and now
this year and last, not a boat has gone out, not
a gleam of sun, not a blink of moonlight has
been upon the sea; and as to the land, it is more
changed still. Where the barley-fields were as
green as a rich pasture three years ago, there
are only a few straggling blades, just enough to
tempt a man with thoughts of what a harvest is.
This is a change we little feared to see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And yet,” said Ella, “many did foresee,
and all might have foreseen. When was there
ever a time that the seasons did not change?
Here we have been too slow to learn God’s will.
We knew that the same storms that took away
our occupation must cut off our harvest; we
knew that such stormy seasons come from time
to time; and yet we acted as if we were promised
plenty for ever. Our children look up to
us for food, because we have given them no
warning that it should cease; and they are right.
But if we look up to God in the same manner
we are wrong; for the warning was given long
ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have heard uncle Ronald speak of it,” replied
Kenneth. “He has often feared that
scarcity would come; but he told me that father,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.75'>75</span>and widow Cuthbert, and the Duffs, would never
be taken by surprise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If it had not been for our savings,” replied
Ella, “we should have had worse things to undergo
than may be in store for us. Instead of
trembling for Jamie, I might have been mourning
the half of my children. Instead of grieving
to see you wasting, Kenneth—how thin ye are
grown!—I might have been——” She stopped.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I am thin, mother,” Kenneth replied, “it
is with care; and my care is that I can do nothing
for bread for myself and you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will take you at your word,” replied his
mother, with a smile. “We will try whether
you will grow stouter for your conscience being
at rest. But, mind, it shall be but a moderate
trial, and I will share it with you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth looked eagerly to his mother for an
explanation of what was in her mind. Ella told
him that there was positively no more grain to
be bought before harvest. Farmer Duff had
very wisely kept back enough for seed-corn, in
case of the crop failing utterly, and had very
reasonably laid up a sufficient store for his own
household; and none was now left over. Ella’s
remaining store was not sufficient to afford even
a stinted allowance to the whole family for the
three months still to come; and she now, therefore,
proposed that neither she nor her son should
touch barley or oatmeal, but give up their share
to the younger and tenderer members of the family.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth was grateful to his mother for her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.76'>76</span>confidence. She had hitherto concealed the fact
of the supply being nearly exhausted, in the
hope that Kenneth, like the rest, would eat and
think little of the future; but she now saw that
he would be made happier by being allowed to
share her sacrifices, and she therefore called upon
him to do so.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth was not yet satisfied. It was not
enough to be permitted to save food; he must
find out how to obtain it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not enough!” exclaimed his mother, mournfully.
“My boy, ye little know what it is, and
ye never can till the trial is made. Ye little
know what it is to lie down at night cold and
aching, and to toss about unable to sleep, when
sleep seems the one thing that would give ye
ease, since ye cannot have food. Ye little think
what sleep is when it comes,—how horrible fancies
are ever rising up to steal away the sweetness
of rest—how all that ye see and all that ye
touch turns to food, and turns back again before
ye can get it to your mouth; or, worse still, to
fancy ye are driven by some evil power to strangle
and devour whatever is most precious to you.
Ye little think what it is to wake with a parched
mouth and hands clenched, so that they are like
an infant’s all the day after, and the limbs trembling
and the sight dim, as if fifty years had
come over ye in a night. Ye little know, Kenneth,
what it will be to loathe the food you and
I shall have, and to see the thoughtless little ones
crumbling the bannocks and eating them as if
they were to be had as easily as the hailstones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.77'>77</span>that have beat down the crops. Wait a while,
my boy, before you say all this is not enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know too well, mother, what it is. Can
it be that you have been fasting alone already?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I learned all this,” said Ella, evading the
question, “when I was nearly as young as you.
There was a scarcity then, and we had a sore
struggle. My father was never well after that
season. There was no need, thank God, to stint
the lads as we stinted ourselves; and, as for me,
the only harm,” she continued, smiling, “was,
that your father found me less comely when he
came back than I had been when he went away.
There is also this good,—that there is one among
us who has gone through evil times, and knows
how to abide them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Teach me, mother. How shall I get such
food as we may live on?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There will be no positive want of food yet,
my boy, though it will be such as will not nourish
us like that we have been used to. We must
try shell-fish, without bannocks or potatoes;
merely shell-fish, day after day; and the strongest
soon grow weak on such diet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would rather give up my share, sometimes,”
said Kenneth, “than gather them at the cost of
what I see. I have been glad you were at home
when the tide went down, and I would not let
the little ones come and help, lest they should
learn to fight like the hungry people on the
shore. Dan, that ever kept his eyes half-shut at
noon, now watches the first falling of the water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.78'>78</span>and bullies every one, if it be Noreen herself,
that sees a shell before he snatches it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Their potatoes have not come up,” observed
Ella, “and they begin to be pinched the very
first, because they had nothing to give for meal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then,” continued Kenneth, “the Murdochs
have got the ill-will of all the neighbours,
by their stripping every child they meet of whatever
he may be carrying home. The very babies
are learning to curse Meg Murdoch.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And so you took their part,” said Ella, smiling,
“and let them strip you in turn. You are right
not to let your little brothers go down with you to
learn theft and covetousness; but you must not
go on giving away your own share, now that you
will have no bread at home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then there are the fowl,” said Kenneth.
“They are not food for the delicate, to be sure,
at this season; but we must try whether they
will not nourish us till better days come. The
worst of it is that very few are left, and those
are the oldest and toughest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The neighbours that are poorer than we
have been everywhere before us,” said Ella.
“But they are welcome. Since they trusted to
chance, the first chances are their due. My eyes
are dim with watching yon boat, and I can see
nothing: is it still there, or has the mist come
over it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella had scarcely withdrawn her gaze for a
moment from her husband’s struggle with the
winds and waves. Kenneth, who had not thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.79'>79</span>strained his sight, could just discern the speck
rising and falling on the dreary waste of waters.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see her still winning her way, mother;
but you will scarce make her out again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will not try now, but go home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And to bed,” said Kenneth. “You are
weary and half-frozen, standing on this point as
if ye came to meet the storm. Promise me you
will rest, mother!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps I will if Jamie is still asleep. And
do you hasten down, Kenneth, and gather whatever
the tide may have thrown up. Now, don’t
part with all you get for your own share. I have
called upon you for self-denial; and part of that
self-denial must be not to give all the help you
have been accustomed to yield.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the worst part of it,” said Kenneth;
“but I remember, mother, that my first duty lies
at home. O, if there were no hardship, how
much less greedy and quarrelsome should we be!
It is not in men’s nature to quarrel for shell-fish
every time the tide goes down.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Remember,” said Ella, “that better things
also arise out of hardship. Do none learn patience?
Do none practise self-denial?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But we have not known extreme hardship,
mother.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True. May the day never come when I
shall see my children looking with jealousy upon
one another! The jealousy of the starving is a
fearful sight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth’s first trial of his new resolution
awaited him when he went down to the shore to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.80'>80</span>gather shell-fish. His appearance was usually
a signal for the children, who were driven away
by some one of the tyrants of the neighbourhood,
to come down and put themselves under
his protection. They had learned to reckon on
his share being divided among them; for, while
there was food at home, he could not find in his
heart to refuse the little half-starved creatures
their piteous requests. One found that some of her
pickings were mere empty shells; another pleaded
that she had no breakfast on the mornings when
it was her turn to look for fish; and another declared
that his father would beat him if he did
not carry home his bonnetful. One or all of
these pleas usually emptied Kenneth’s store. One
set of claimants had never yet been refused,—his
cousins. Fergus’s two eldest boys, who had
earned good wages, and hoped to earn them
again when the fishery should be resumed, were
thrown back on their own resources in the interval.
It was melancholy to see them wandering about
the island in search of anything that might be
rendered eatable, and at times reduced to beg of
their cousin Kenneth as many shell-fish as he
could spare. Kenneth felt that nothing but absolute
famine could drive him to deny them; and
he was therefore glad to perceive that they were
not on the shore this morning. He gave notice
to the little ones, who now gathered about him,
that he could henceforth only help them by defending
their right to whatever they could pick
up. He must share equally with them from this
day, and he hoped they would not ask that which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.81'>81</span>he could no longer give. And now began the
scenes which he was henceforth daily to witness
among the children, and in time, upon a larger
scale, among the parents. All the petty arts,
all the violence, all the recklessness, to which
the needy are tempted, began to show themselves
first among those whose habits of self-control were
weakest; and afforded a specimen of what might
be looked for when the parents should be driven
by want beyond the restraint of principles and
habits which had been powerful in the absence
of overwhelming temptation.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the little boys uplifted a vehement cry.
“Willie has snatched my bonnet! O, my bonnet,
my bonnet! It was fuller to-day than it has
ever been yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the very reason,” cried Willie, a
stout lad, who felt that he could carry everything
among the little ones by strength of arm. “You
never had enough before to make it worth while
taking them. Now I have got them, I will keep
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth, who was the representative of justice,
struggled with Willie, and got back the
property; but the lad vowed vengeance for his
drubbing, especially against the complainant,
who henceforth had no peace. All parties being
left discontented, it was plainly a great evil that
there had been temptation to recur to what Willie
called the right of the strongest.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the little girls was found hidden behind
a rock, eating all that had been collected
for the family at home. Many cried “Shame!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.82'>82</span>and vowed she should never again be trusted
within reach of more than her own share; to
which she answered, that she should eat when
she was hungry, and that those who had enough
might supply her brothers and sisters. This
child would have had a rate levied upon all
the more provident, for the relief of her fellow-paupers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two lads having quarrelled about the share
due to one, the most hungry threw the whole
back into the sea, by way of revenge as he declared.
One would have thought he had heard
Mr. Mackenzie speak of the possible, though
extreme, case of men burning stacks because
there was not enough corn.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even this reckless boy was less provoking
than one party, pre-eminent in poverty and dirt,
who could not be persuaded to give over their
sport, happen what might. They called together
whatever animals could eat shell-fish, and put this
food down the mouths of dogs and ponys,—both
of which eat fish in the islands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How can you,” said Kenneth, “bring more
eaters down to the shore when we have too many
already?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We must have our play,” answered they.
“Ours is the age for play, as we have heard our
father say; and we are so cold and hungry almost
all day, that it is very hard if we may not
amuse ourselves when we can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no use in pointing out to them that
they were doing all they could to increase their
own hunger; they only answered that they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.83'>83</span>have their sport as long as they could get it, and
immediately whistled for more dogs.</p>

<p class='c001'>To judge by their acts, these children did not
perceive that, though they could not determine
the quantity of fish which should be within reach,
it was their fault that the number of eaters was
needlessly increased. The half-starved multitudes
of an over-peopled kingdom might take a lesson
from their folly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Can this be the place,” thought Kenneth,
“can these be the children, where and among
whom there was so much cheerfulness but a few
seasons ago? How happy we all used to be
picking up our fish! And now, some still laugh
louder than ever; but the mirth of the destitute
is more painful to witness than the grave looks
of those who have something left. O, for peace
and plenty once more!”</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span> <br /> <br /> THE DISCIPLINE OF THE TEACHABLE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>As Ella slowly took her way homewards, she
caught a glimpse of two men coming up the
winding path she was descending. Forgetting
the impossibility that Angus should be already
returned, and seeing that one was Fergus, she
supposed that her husband and brother were
coming to meet her. On her turning a point,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.84'>84</span>they were in full view. It was Ronald instead
of Angus. Terror seized the anxious wife, who
was weakened by watching and care.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O Angus, Angus!” she cried, in tones which
made the rocks ring again. “O, he is lost, and
ye are come to tell me!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Before her brothers could reach her, she had
sunk down, unable to keep her hold of the rock,
while the earth seemed to swim round and quake
beneath her. She was lost in a fainting-fit before
a word of comfort could reach her ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This must be fasting as well as care,” said
Ronald, as he chafed her hands, while Fergus
sprinkled water over her face. “Never before
was Ella seen to sink, much less upon a false
alarm. It must be sore suffering that could
bring her to this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fergus’s tears were falling fast while he replied,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis the parent’s heart that suffers, Ronald.
’Tis for her little Jamie that she has watched and
struggled till she faints, spirit and body together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She is coming round,” said Ronald. “There
is colour in her lips. Now see if her spirit does
not rally as soon as her limbs, or sooner. She
will be more surprised at herself than we are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hush! she opened her eyes just now. Raise
her a little more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, Ella,” said Ronald, smiling, as he
leaned over her, “ye never gave me such a
greeting before. Why are ye so sorry to see me
to-day?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.85'>85</span><a id='corr85.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘Is'>“Is</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_85.1'><ins class='correction'>“Is</ins></a></span> nothing the matter?” asked Ella steadily.
“I dreamed there was;—something about Angus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was only a dream, as far as I know. I
have but just landed, and I came to you for news
of Angus and all of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>By this time Ella had started up, and refusing
further assistance, supported herself by leaning
against the rock.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought Fergus looked sad, I thought he
looked wretched,” she continued, gazing wistfully
into her younger brother’s face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“May be ye’re right, Ella; but it was not for
you. A man has enough to make him look
grave in times like these. But I did not mean to
frighten you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Times like these make us all selfish,” said
Ella, “and that is the worst of them. There
was a time, Fergus, when I should have been
quicker-sighted to your sorrow than my own.—But
come with me to shelter before yon cloud
bursts. I have been too long from my sick child
already. Come with me both of ye, and take the
poor welcome I can give. O, it is a comfort,
Ronald, to see ye here!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Her step was little less firm, as her brothers
observed, than their own. At her own door she
charged them to make no one uneasy by speaking
of her fainting-fit. It was a strange fancy,
she said, which would not come over her again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mother, how white you look!” exclaimed
Annie, as they entered.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.86'>86</span>“I am cold, my lass. The wind is piercing
on the heights; so put some more peat to the
fire, and see how you can make your uncles
comfortable while I go to Jamie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jamie was still in his uneasy sleep. He lay
on his back, his mouth open and parched, as if
not a drop of liquid had ever touched his tongue,
his breathing irregular, his bony fingers sometimes
twitching, sometimes drooped with an appearance
of utter helplessness. While his mother
passed her hand over his temples, and watched
his pulse and his countenance, she did not perceive
that any one had followed her into the
chamber. Presently she heard stifled sobs, and
saw that Fergus was kneeling at the foot of the
child’s crib, hiding his face in his plaid.</p>

<p class='c001'>“God help you! God comfort you!” she heard
him say.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You think he will die, Fergus; and you
tremble for your own two sick children. But
hope—at least till you see them as ill as Jamie.
I have hoped till now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fergus’s grief became more violent. His two
infants had died in the night. The fever had
made quicker work where its victims were already
weakened by want. Fergus came to bid
his brothers to the funeral.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella led him out of the chamber, and placed
herself by him, but so that she could see all that
passed by her child’s bedside. She was more
than ever thankful that Ronald had come, when
he succeeded in gaining Fergus’s attention to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.87'>87</span>what he had to say on the present state of
affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>He could give little comfort about the prospect
of an early supply of grain from the neighbouring
islands, as there was a nearly equal degree of
distress throughout. The season that was unfavourable
to one, was so to all; and the same
causes which stopped the fishery laid waste the
land. But though immediate relief was not to
be looked for, it was hoped that help was on the
way. Memorials to government had been sent
from the different stations, and Captain Forbes
was now making a circuit of the islands in order
to estimate the degrees of distress, and to judge
how best to apply the funds the Company proposed
to set apart for the relief of the inhabitants.
He would soon be in Garveloch, and presently
after it was possible a vessel might arrive with
pease, potatoes, or grain. Ronald had no sooner
heard of this prospect of relief than he made his
way over the stormy sea to cheer his sister and
brother with the news. There was doubtless
another, Ella observed, whom he would wish to
tell, though she was thankful to say that widow
Cuthbert suffered less from the pressure of the
times than any family in Garveloch, unless it
was the Duffs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ronald took no notice of this at present; he
reserved what he had to say about Katie till Fergus
should be gone; and proceeded to explain
that he had endeavoured in vain to make a purchase
of meal that he might bring with him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.88'>88</span>There was none to be had for love or money.
But as those who could pay best were served
first, he had received a promise that he should
purchase a portion of the first cargo that passed
the station. He desired that it might be equally
divided between the families of his sister, his
brother, and the widow Cuthbert, and that some
one should be on the watch to secure the package
addressed to Fergus, as soon as the sloop should
approach. Before he even thanked his brother,
Fergus anxiously inquired when the supply would
come? There was no knowing. It might be a
fortnight; it might be two months. He did
feel and express himself grateful, however, and
said something, to which Ronald would not
listen, about repaying, in happier days, that part
of the debt which could be repaid, and then rose
to go and tell his wife that food was or would be
on the way. Ronald called him back as he was
going out at the door, to entreat that he would
never revive the subject of payment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have only myself to work and care for,”
he said, “and whatever is left over is the natural
portion of my kindred. You would inherit it at
my death, you know, Fergus; and it is only
putting it into your hands when you really want
it, instead of waiting till it might be less acceptable
to you and yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon this ensued, as soon as Ronald and his
sister were quite alone, a conversation relating
to the widow Cuthbert. It was long and earnest,
and interrupted only by the attentions necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.89'>89</span>to the little patient. The child, on waking, knew
his uncle Ronald, and submitted to be soothed
and quieted by him while Ella sat spinning beside
the crib.</p>

<p class='c001'>They were thus engaged in the afternoon
when Katie entered. She brought a nourishing
mess for little Jamie, as she had done more than
once before since his illness began. She was
surprised to see Ronald, for visitors were rare in
such a season of storms. She declared herself
vexed at having entered without warning, when
she saw him preparing for immediate departure;
but he said he must be at the station before
night, and had remained too long already; and
as his sister did not press his stay, Katie said no
more about it, but took his offered hand, and
cheerfully confirmed what Ella had told him of
the health and comfort of her family. There
was no need to ask after her own, for she looked,
perhaps from the force of contrast with every
body else, more fresh in health and easy in spirits
than in many former days when less care prevailed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Go, my dears,” said Ella to the children in
the outer room, “and help your uncle with his
boat, and then ye can watch him away round the
point; and mind ye mark whether any other
vessel is in sight. And yet Angus said he should
not be back this day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And now,” said Katie, when she had done
watching how her friend coaxed little Jamie into
swallowing the food she brought, “you must let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.90'>90</span>me have my own way entirely, Ella; for you
know me for a wilful <a id='corr90.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='woman'>woman.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_90.2'><ins class='correction'>woman.</ins></a></span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me hear your will before I promise,
Katie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My will is to change house and family with
you to-night. You must put my children to bed
for me, and eat my supper, which you will find
in the cupboard, and then lie down in my bed,
and sleep till the sun is high. You can trust
me to nurse Jamie, I know, from what you said
when my Hugh struggled through the measles;
and you may quite depend on it, Kenneth says,
that your husband will not return to-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella had no foolish scruples about accepting
this neighbourly offer. She had watched many
nights, and was so nearly exhausted, that this
was a very seasonable help, she thought, to the
better performance of her duties the next day.
She had been ever ready to give similar assistance
to her neighbours in like cases; and knowing
the pleasure of doing friendly acts, she would
not refuse it to Katie. She therefore agreed at
once, adding,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure you would not offer this if you
had any fear of your children taking the fever
from me or you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not, Ella. You know nobody was
more careful than I when the small-pox was in
the island; and I offended several neighbours
by not letting my children so much as speak
with theirs; but this kind of fever is not given
and taken, as I have good reason to be sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.91'>91</span>In a little while, seeing that Ella was moving
about as if to prepare for her comfort during
the evening and night, she called her to come
and sit down, and not trouble herself with any
more cares this day.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That which will do for you,” she said,
“will do for me; and if I want anything, there
will be Annie to tell me where to find it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m willing enough to sit down with ye,”
said Ella, when she had fed the fire, and resumed
her spinning, “because——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because you cannot stand; is not that it,
Ella? You still look as white as if you had
seen a ghost. So you took Ronald for a ghost
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fergus should not have told you that silly
story. No; I am willing to be alone with you,
because I have much to say about Ronald. You
need never more look as you do now, Katie. I
am going to lay a different plea before you this
day; and if ye will grant it, it will be my last.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Katie bent over her work, and made no reply;
so Ella proceeded.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know as well as I how long Ronald
has loved you, and how sore a struggle your
marriage was to him, and that there have been
times since when he has hoped; but you have
never known, as I have, how tossed in mind he
has been for more than three years past. He
has come and gone, and come again, Katie,
watching your feelings, and waiting for what he
thought your pleasure, till he often lost all power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.92'>92</span>of judging what he should do, and how he
should speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure,” said Katie, “it was as far from
my wish as from my knowledge that his mind
should be so tossed. I never willingly left any
one in uncertainty, and I have far too much
respect for Ronald, far too much——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Neither he nor I ever had such a thought,
Katie, as that ye would trifle with him or any
man. If he had, ye would soon have seen an end
of his love. The uncertainty was no fault of yours,
and it was only from particular causes that it
lasted so long. He has said many a time that
if you had been a young girl, he would have
spoken out and known your mind at once; but
your husband was his friend, and there was no
measuring what your feelings might be now, and
he feared above all things wounding them; and
so he lingered and lingered and never spoke, till
circumstances have decided the matter he could
not decide for himself. He wishes you to know,
Katie, that you may lay aside all fear of him.
He gives you his word of honour he will never
sue you; and if, as he suspects, he has occasioned
you uneasiness, he entreats your pardon,
and hopes you will dismiss it all from your
mind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is this the plea you spoke of?” asked Katie.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; the plea I spoke of may be, perhaps,
more easily granted. Let me entreat for him
that you will regard him freely as an old friend,
as a brother. He will think no more of marriage;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.93'>93</span>and I know nothing would make him so
happy as being able to watch over and help us
all equally. Your children love him, Katie; and
if you will only do as I do, give him a welcome
when he comes and a blessing when he departs,
and ask him for aid, and take what he offers, and
let him keep watch upon your children for their
good, there may be an end of all difficulty, and
my brother may be happier than he has been for
many a year. It will ever be painful to be like
strangers or common acquaintance; and you
have his word of honour,—and whose word is
so sure?—that he will not seek to be more than
friend; the only way for his peace and your ease
is to be really friends,—as if ye were both the
children of the same parents. Let Ronald be
your friend as he is mine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not aware,” said Katie, “of either
act or word which need make me scruple to give
and take friendship in the way you wish. But,
Ella, you must answer me one question plainly;
is it anything in myself which made Ronald
change his views? I should not have asked this
if you had not said that he gave up marriage
altogether; but since I know that his thoughts
are not turning upon any one else, I should like
to be told whether he has less esteem for me
than before I married?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he had, would he seek your friendship as
he does? If he esteemed or thought he ever
should esteem you less, he would just keep away
from Garveloch, and tell nobody why, unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.94'>94</span>perhaps myself. No; he feels as he ever did;
and lest you should doubt me, I will tell you
all I know of his conscience and his judgment
on this matter. It is the state of society in the
islands, Katie, that makes him and other thoughtful
men give up the intention of marrying.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And some that are not thoughtful too, Ella.
I could tell you of more than one that would
fain have had me when there was prospect that
my boys would be a little fortune to me,—I
mean when labour was scarce,—that have now
slunk away, and will never hold out a hand to
me again, I dare say, till my family promise to
be a profit instead of a burden.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not take Ronald to be one of these!”
cried Ella indignantly. “You cannot think that
he is one to come forward and go back as your
fortune waxes and wanes, whether that fortune
be your children or your savings! It is not for
himself only, but for you and your children, and
for us and for society, that he thinks and acts as
he does.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Katie did not doubt it.—Ronald was far from
selfish.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If all was bright with us again in a single
month,” said Ella, “he would keep in the same
mind; for he sees that prosperity can never last
long among us, while we make no provision
against the changes that must ever befall, while
seasons are sometimes stormy and our commerce
liable to variations. We have made an abundant
season and a brisk demand into curses, by acting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.95'>95</span>as if they were always to last; and now we want
many such as he to soften our miseries, which
he could not do if he were burdened like us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it is hard,” observed Katie, “that he
must deny himself because his neighbours are
imprudent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet his lot is best, Katie. It is sweet to him
to help us in our need; and he is spared the
sorrow of seeing his little ones pine for that
which he cannot give. Yet he cannot but feel
that he bears more than his share in giving up
marriage altogether. If there were no O’Rorys
to marry at eighteen, and if most others had the
prudence to wait some years longer than they
do, all who wish might marry and deserve no
blame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But who thinks of praise or blame about the
act of marrying?” said Katie. “I own that
they ought. When one looks round and sees
how sin and sorrow grow where hunger prevails,
one cannot think any man guiltless who overlooks
the chance of his increasing the poverty
of society. But how few consider this! Those
who think themselves conscientious, go no farther
than to consider whether they are marrying
the right person. They spend no thought on
the time and the manner, or on their duty to
society.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is so even here,” said Ella, “where we
can trace the causes of distress: and in great
cities, where it is easy to lay the blame in the
wrong place, and where the people become the
more reckless the poorer they grow, the evil is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.96'>96</span>much greater. There children are born whose
youthful parents have neither roofs to shelter,
nor clothes to cover them; and the more widely
poverty spreads through the multitude of labourers,
the faster is that multitude doubled. You
have seen enough of cities, Katie, to know that
this is true.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and all this is done in the name of
Providence. I always expected next to hear
Providence blamed for not giving food enough
for all this multitude.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such blame would have been as reasonable
as the excuse,” said Ella. “But how slow we
are to learn the will of Providence in this case,
when it is the very same that we understand in
other cases! Providence gave us strength of
limbs and of passions: yet these we restrain for
the sake of living in society. If a man used his
hands to pull down his neighbour’s house, or his
passion of anger to disturb the society in which
he lives, we should think it no excuse that Providence
had given him his natural powers, or made
him enjoy their exercise. How is it more excusable
for a man to bring children into the
world, when there are so many to be fed that
every one that is born must help to starve one
already living?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since Providence has not made food increase
as men increase,” said Katie, “it is plain
that Providence wills restraint here as in the
case of other passions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And awful are the tokens of its pleasure,
Katie. The tears of mothers over their dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.97'>97</span>children, that shrunk under poverty like blossoms
withering before the frosts, the fading of the
weak, the wasting of the strong, thefts in the
streets, sickness in the houses, funerals by the
wayside—these are the tokens that unlimited
increase is not God’s will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“These tell us where we are wrong, Ella.
How shall we learn how we may be right?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By doing as you have done through life,
Katie; by using our judgment, and such power
as we have. We have not the power of increasing
food as fast as our numbers may
increase; but we have the power of limiting our
numbers to agree with the supply of food. This
is the gentle check which is put into our own
hands; and if we will not use it, we must not
repine if harsher checks follow. If the passionate
man will not restrain his anger, he must expect
punishment at the hands of him whom he has
injured; and if he imprudently indulges his
love, he must not complain when poverty, disease,
and death lay waste his family.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not you think, Ella, that there are more
parties to a marriage than is commonly supposed?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is a party,” replied Ella, smiling,
“that if it could be present, would often forbid
the banns; and it is this party that Ronald has
now consulted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You mean society.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes. In savage life, marriage may be a
contract between a man and woman only, for
their mutual pleasure; but if they lay claim to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.98'>98</span>the protection and advantages of society, they
are responsible to society. They have no right
to provide for a diminution of its resources; and
therefore, when they marry, they form a tacit
contract with society to bring no members into
it who shall not be provided for, by their own
labour or that of their parents. No man is a
good citizen who runs the risk of throwing the
maintenance of his children on others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, Ella! did you consider this before your
ten children were born?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, Katie, there seemed no doubt to my
husband and me that our children would be well
provided for. There were then few labourers in
Garveloch, and a prospect of abundant provision;
and even now we are not in poverty.
We have money, clothes, and furniture; and
that we have not food enough is owing to those
who, having saved nothing, are now far more
distressed than we are. Let us hope that all
will take warning. My husband and I shall be
careful to teach those of our children who are
spared to us how much easier it is to prevent
want than to endure it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You and I will do what we can, Ella,
to make our children prudent in marriage; and
if all our neighbours would do the same, we
might look forward cheerfully. But so few take
warning! And it is so discouraging to the
prudent to find themselves left almost alone!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, Katie; it is not as if all must work
together to do any good. Every prudent man,
like Ronald, not only prevents a large increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.99'>99</span>of mischief, but, by increasing capital, does a
positive good. Every such act of restraint tells;
every such wise resolution stops one drain on
the resources of society. Surely this knowledge
affords grounds for a conscientious man to act
upon, without doubt and discouragement.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How differently is honour imputed in different
times!” said Katie, smiling. “The times
have been when they who had brought the most
children into the world were thought the greatest
benefactors of society; and now we are honouring
those most who have none. Yet both may
have been right in their time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A change of place serves the same purpose
as change of time,” replied Ella. “If Ronald
were in a new colony, where labour was more in
request than anything else, he would be honoured
for having ten children, and doubly
honoured for having twenty. And reasonably
too; for, in such a case, children would be a
gift, and not a burden to society.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a pity, Ella, that all should not go there
who are too poor to marry properly, and have
no relish for the honour of a single life. Dan
and his wife would be a treasure to a new
colony.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If they and their children would work,
Katie; not otherwise. But the poor little things
would have a better chance of life there. If
Noreen stays here, she may be too like many a
Highland mother;—she may tell of her twenty
children, and leave but one or two behind her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My heart aches for those poor infants,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.100'>100</span>Katie. “One would almost as soon hear that
they were put out of the way at their birth, as
see them dwindle away and drop into their little
graves one after another, before they are four
years old. I have often heard that neither the
very rich nor the very poor leave such large
families behind them as the middling classes;
and if the reason is known, it seems to me very
like murder not to prevent it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The reasons are well known, Katie. Those
who live in luxury and dissipation have fewer
children born to them than any class; but those
that are born are guarded from the wants and
diseases which cut off the families of the very
poor. The middling classes are more prudent
than the lowest, and have therefore fewer children
than they, though more than the luxurious;
and they rear a much larger proportion than
either.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“One might look far, Ella, among the lords
and ladies in London, or among the poor Paisley
weavers, before one would find such a healthy,
hearty tribe——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As yours,” Katie would have said; but
seeing Ella look upon her little Jamie with a
deep sigh, she stopped short, but presently went
on—</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me that a lady of fashion, who
gives up her natural rest for feasting and playing
cards all night long in a hot room, and lets
herself be driven about in a close carriage instead
of taking the air on her own limbs, can have no
more wish to rear a large healthy family than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.101'>101</span>Noreen, who lets her babe dangle as if she
meant to break its back, and gives the poor
thing nothing but potatoes, when it ought to be
nourished with the best of milk and wholesome
bread. Both are little better than the mothers
in China. O Ella! did your husband ever tell
you of the children in China?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, but I scarcely believed even his word
for it. Who told you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have read it in more books than one; and
I know that the same thing is done in India; so
I am afraid it is all too true. In India it is
a very common thing for female children to be
destroyed as soon as born.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The temptation is strong, Katie, where the
people are so poor that many hundred thousand
at a time die of famine. But child murder is
yet more common in China, where no punishment
follows, and nothing can exceed the distress
for food. In great cities, new-born babes
are nightly laid in the streets to perish, and many
more are thrown into the river, and carried away
before their parents’ eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is even said, Ella that there are persons
whose regular business it is to drown infants
like puppies.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O horrible! And how far must people be
corrupted before they would bear children to
meet such a fate!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is nothing so corrupting as poverty,
Ella; and there is no poverty like that of the
Chinese.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And yet China is called the richest country
in the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.102'>102</span>“And so it may be. It may produce more
food in proportion to its bounds—it may contain
more wealth of every sort than any country in
the world, and may at the same time contain
more paupers. We call newly-settled countries
poor countries because they contain comparatively
little capital; but the happiness of the
people does not depend on the total amount of
wealth, but on its proportion to those who are to
enjoy it. What country was ever poorer than
Garveloch twenty years ago? Yet nobody was
in want. What country is so rich as China at
this day? Yet there multitudes eat putrid dogs
and cats, and live in boats for want of a house,
and follow the English ships, to pick up and
devour the most disgusting garbage that they
throw overboard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Suppose such should be the lot of our native
kingdom,” said Ella, shuddering. “Such is the
natural course of things when a nation multiplies
its numbers without a corresponding increase of
food. May it be given to all to see this before
we reach the pass of the Chinese!—and even if
we never reach it—if, as is more likely, the evil
is palliated by the caution of the prudent, by the
emigration of the enterprising, and by other
means which may yet remain, may we learn to
use them before we are driven to it by famine
and disease!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is fearful enough, Ella, to witness what
is daily before our eyes. God forbid that the
whole kingdom should be in the state that Garveloch
is in now!”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.103'>103</span>“In very many towns, Katie, there is always
distress as great as our neighbours’ now; and
so there will be till they that hold the power in
their own hands—not the king, not the parliament,
not the rich only, but the body of the
people, understand those natural laws by which
and under which they subsist.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Many would be of Ella’s opinion, if they
could, like her, see the operation of the principle
of increase within narrow bounds; for nothing
can be plainer, nothing more indisputable when
fully understood. In large societies, the mind
of the observer is perplexed by the movements
around him. The comings and goings, the
births, deaths, and accidents, defy his calculations;
and there are always persons at hand
who help to delude him by talking in a strain
which would have suited the olden time, but
which is very inappropriate to the present state
of things. In every city, however crowded with
a half-starved population, there are many more
who do their utmost to encourage population
than can give a sound reason for their doing so;
and while their advice is ringing in the ears, and
their example is before the eyes, and there is no
lack of inaccurate explanations why our workhouses
are overflowing, our hospitals thronged,
and our funeral bells for ever tolling, it is difficult
to ascertain the real state of the case. But
when the observation is exercised within a
narrow range, the truth becomes immediately
apparent,—it becomes evident that since capital
increases in a slower ratio than population, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.104'>104</span>will be sooner or later a deficiency of food, unless
the more vigorous principle of increase be
controlled. If the welfare of a nation depended
on the hare not reaching the goal before the
tortoise, there might be some who would insist
till the last moment that they moved at an equal
pace, and ought, therefore, to be let alone; but
there would be some who, trusting to their own
eyes, would take precautionary measures: they
might let the hare run till she overtook the
tortoise, but then they would put on a clog.
If any complain that this is not a fair race, the
answer is that the hare and the tortoise were not
made to vie with each other in speed; and if we
set them to do it, we must manage the competition
with a view to the consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella and Katie, sensible and unprejudiced, and
rendered quick-sighted by anxiety for their children,
were peculiarly qualified for seeing the
truth when fairly placed before them. Their
interest in Ronald, as well as in their own
offspring, gave them a view of both sides of the
question; and there remained not a doubt, after
calculating numbers and resources, that there
must be some check to the increase of the people,
and that the prudential check is infinitely preferable
to those of vice and misery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the griefs attending the latter, Ella could
form some idea—though her feelings were not
embittered by self-reproach—when she looked in
the face of her sick child, who was now resting
his aching head on her bosom. She could not
leave him, though it was growing late, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.105'>105</span>he closed his heavy eyes, and let her lay him on
his pillow. Then Annie came to bear the widow
company for an hour or two; and Ella went to
pass the night in her friend’s dwelling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shall never have any reserves in our
confidence henceforth, Ella,” said Katie, smiling.
“There has been but one subject on which I was
not always glad to hear you speak; and now that
one is settled for ever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was glad that Katie had thus spoken, for
she had not been perfectly sure of her friend’s
state of feeling. She now gazed affectionately
on that youthful face, touched but not withered
by early sorrow, and kissed the forehead of the
friend she loved like a younger sister, and whom
she could not have regarded as such more tenderly
if they had been made sisters by marriage.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.</span> <br /> <br /> THE DISCIPLINE OF THE UNTEACHABLE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Angus was restored safe to his home; but his
return was melancholy enough. He was blown
over the Sound by a storm, and landed at the
moment that the funeral train who bore the
bodies of Fergus’s two children were winding up
the rocks to the burial-place. The anxious father
was naturally possessed with the idea that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.106'>106</span>was the funeral of the child he had left so ill;
and he was confirmed in the supposition by seeing
none of his family on the beach to await his
arrival. Kenneth and his brothers were among
the mourners, and Angus therefore found his wife
and the girls alone when, with a throbbing heart,
he entered his own dwelling. Ella met him with
a calm but sad countenance, which, together with
the silent awe with which the children looked up
to him, answered but too plainly the question he
would have asked. Little Jamie had died a
few hours before in his mother’s arms. The
last words he spoke had been to call for his
father.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O, why was I not here?” exclaimed the
mourning parent, laying his cheek to that of his
boy, as if the cold body could be conscious of the
caress. “It must have been an evil spirit that
decoyed me away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Alas, then, your voyage has been in vain!”
said Ella. “You have brought no bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus shook his head mournfully, and cast
down the pouch of useless money that came back
as full as it went out. The scarcity extended
through all the neighbourhood, and no food was
to be bought at any price. Ella saw her husband’s
look of despondency, and rallied. She
reminded him that they had a stock of meal,
though a scanty one, and she held out the hope,
suggested by Ronald’s information, that a sloop
would soon arrive with food enough to afford a
temporary supply to all the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c001'>It had been agreed between Fergus and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.107'>107</span>sister that a constant watch for this vessel should
be kept from daybreak till dark by the elder
children of each family. Annie was now at the
post in the absence of Kenneth, and Ella tempted
her husband out with her, to pronounce whether
the look-out was well chosen. She saw that his
grief was too new to allow him to receive the
condolence of neighbours who might step in on
their return from the funeral. She was glad she
had done so when she saw Annie putting back
the hair which the stormy wind blew over her
face, and evidently straining her sight to discern
some object at sea. Angus had his glass with
him, and in the intervals of the driving mists, he
plainly perceived a sloop coming up from the
south.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Away with you, with me for your helper!”
cried Ella. “We will be at sea before any one
knows what is coming; and then we shall escape
contention, and the sight of contention. And
you, Annie, tell none but your uncle and Kenneth
where we are gone. If it should not be
the right sloop, it would be cruel to raise false
hopes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Besides, mother, the people would tear ye
to pieces, or at least the boat—they are grown
so savage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They would very likely fancy we were going
to snatch their share, instead of to receive a
regular purchase. Farewell, my lass,” she continued,
as they reached the boat; “Kenneth will
soon be with you, and ye may give us a smile when
we land, if yon be the vessel we take her for.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.108'>108</span>“But, O father, the squalls are so rough! I
fear to let you go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never fear, Annie. The Flora knows the
greeting of a summer squall. She will win her
way out hardly enough; but you will see her
bounding back as if she was racing with the
gale.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There were many loungers on the beach when
Angus and Ella cleared out. Some were invalids,
who could not be kept within their cheerless
homes even by the chill and boisterous weather.
Many were idlers; and all made sport of what
they thought the useless toil of going to sea at
such a time. Their jokes would have been painful
and perhaps irritating to Angus if he had not
had reason to hope that relief was on the way to
himself and them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did ye bring home such a cargo this morning
that ye are tempted to try your luck again?”
cried one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Make haste!” exclaimed another, “or ye’ll
scarcely find the shoal. It’s a brave summer
day for casting a net.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or for angling,” observed a third. “Where
are your lines, neighbour? Nothing like a smooth
sea for ladies’ fishing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye must treat us each with a supper when
you come back, Angus,” said a fourth, “unless
indeed the fishes should make a supper of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I trust there may be a supper for every one
in Garveloch this night,” observed Ella, as the
final shout reached the rolling and pitching vessel;
and these cheering words were the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.109'>109</span><a id='corr109.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='she she'>she</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_109.1'><ins class='correction'>she</ins></a></span> spoke, as all her husband’s attention and her
own was required to direct their rough and somewhat
perilous course.</p>

<p class='c001'>Never was such a commotion excited in Garveloch
as upon the spread of the tidings that a
vessel had arrived at the quay with a certain
quantity of grain and an ample supply of pease.
The eagle was startled from her nest by the
uproar. The more shrill grew the blast, the
louder rose the voices; the higher swelled the
tide over the bar, the greater was the eagerness
to cross it as the shortest way to the quay. The
men sent their wives home for whatever little
wealth they had to offer in exchange, in case the
food was to be purchased and not given, while
they themselves hastened to secure the point
whence they might best bid or entreat. Here a
poor invalid, putting forth his utmost power to
keep up with his competitors, was jostled aside
or thrown down by the passers by. There a
band of children were beginning a noisy rejoicing
for they scarcely knew what; some among
them half-crying in the midst of their shouting
from hunger and pain, which would not be forgotten.
The only quiet people in the island
were Angus’s family, and their ill-thriving neighbours
round the point.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the Flora, dimly seen in the twilight,
came bounding in as her master had foretold,
no one awaited her on the beach but those who
had watched the whole expedition, Fergus, Kenneth,
and his sister. The expected supply of
meal was safe, and Fergus lost no time in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.110'>110</span>conveying it out of sight, and into a place of
safety.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I brought down the money, father,” said
Kenneth, producing the pouch, “that you might
buy more at the quay, if you wish it, before it is
all gone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, my boy,” said Angus. “We have
enough for the present, and I will neither take
what others want more than we, nor raise the
price by increasing the demand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Murdochs and O’Rorys were the last to
know what had happened, as little was heard of
the tumult beyond the point. They were extremely
and almost equally wretched, and were
far from attempting to soften their distresses by
sympathy and neighbourly offices. Those who
are most heedless of adversity in prospect, do
not usually bear it best when it comes; and so
it proved in the instance of both these families.
Murdoch, who, when he might have been prosperous,
was too lazy to do more than trust he
should get through well enough, now cast all
the blame of his destitution on Dan’s assurances
that it would be the easiest thing in life to live,
if he would only grow potatoes. Dan, who was
content any way when causes of discontent were
only in prospect, forgot there was such a thing
as content when the natural consequences of his
recklessness came upon him. It had been a
terrible day when the absolute want of food had
driven both to dig up their seed potatoes. Murdoch
had foresight enough to be appalled at the
prospect of the long destitution which this measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.111'>111</span>must cause. Dan laughed at him for supposing
that anything better could be done in a
season so wet that every root would rot in the
ground instead of growing; but he did not the
less grumble at “the powers” for giving him
nothing better to eat than half-rotten roots, that
afforded no more strength than his own puny
infant had and was losing day by day. Noreen
often looked rueful with two black eyes, and did
not insist so vehemently as formerly on her Dan
being “the beautifullest husband in nature;”
and as for the child, its best friends could only
hope it would follow Noreen’s former dangling
“babbies,” and be laid in peace under the sod.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first news these neighbours had of the
arrival of the vessel from the station was from
Kenneth, who goodnaturedly remembered to run
and give them the information in time to afford
them a fair chance in the scramble. Murdoch
seized his staff and was off in an instant.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stay, neighbour,” cried Kenneth, who was
not aware of the extent of Murdoch’s poverty;
“the buyers have the first chance you know.
Better not go empty-handed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murdoch thought he was jeering, and shook
his stick at him with a gesture of passion, which
Kenneth could not resent when he saw how the
old man’s limbs shook, and how vain were his
attempts at unusual speed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dan jumped up at the news, snatched his
baby, and gave it a toss which was enough to
shake its weak frame to pieces, seized upon
Noreen for a kiss in answer to the shriek with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.112'>112</span>which she received the child, snatched the pot in
which the last batch of rotten potatoes was
boiling, and threw out its contents into the
puddle beside the door, and ran off, laughing at
his wife’s lamentations for the only bit of food
she had had to put between her teeth this day.
Kenneth now perceived that Dan could bestir
himself upon occasion; and indeed the Irishman’s
glee was so obstreperous, that it might have been
supposed his mirth was owing to his favourite
“sperits,” if it had not been known that he had
been long without the means of procuring himself
that indulgence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such a man’s mirth is easily turned to rage.
On reaching the sloop, which was fast emptying
of its contents, Dan found that he stood a worse
chance of a supply than anybody in Garveloch,
except Murdoch, who still lagged behind. To
come empty-handed and to come late was a double
disqualification; and to be kept at a distance
by force put Dan into a passion which was only
equalled by his neighbour’s, when he also arrived
at the scene of action. It was the policy of the
bystanders to turn their rage upon each other.
As soon as an opening appeared among the
group on the quay, through which the sloop
might be approached, they pushed the old man
forward, and held Dan back, urging that a
hearty youth like him, and a stranger, would not
surely force his way before an old man, who
had been born and bred in the place; but Dan
kicked, struggled, dealt his blows right and left,
and at last sprang upon Murdoch, snatched off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.113'>113</span>his bonnet, and buffeted him about the face
with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You graceless wretch!” exclaimed all who
were at leisure to look on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let him uncover gray hairs that helped to
make them gray,” said Murdoch, in a voice of
forced calmness. “It was he that lured me to
poverty, and now let him glory in it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s owing to your gray hairs I did not beat
you blind this minute,” cried Dan. “I’d have
you keep a civil tongue in your head, if you’d
have your eyes stay there too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would peril my eyes to say it again,” cried
the old man. “It was you that lured me to
poverty with saying that Ireland was the brightest
and merriest land under the sun, and the only
country where a man may live and be content
without trouble.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By the holy poker, so it is, barring such reprobates
as you are in it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You told me that I spent my labour for
nothing, and worse than nothing, when I grew
oats and barley. You told me that I might get
three times as much food out of the ground, by
growing potatoes instead. You——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All true, by the saints, villain as you are to
doubt my word! There’s three times the victuals
in an Irishman’s field, and three times the childer
in his cabin, and three times the people on the
face of the blessed land, that there is where the
folks are so mighty high that they must have
bread.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.114'>114</span>“And three times the number die,” said a
voice near, “when a bad season comes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what if they do?” cried Dan: “’tis a
blessed land for all that, with a golden sun to live
under, and a green turf to lie under.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s a vile country,” cried Murdoch, emboldened
by hope of support from the bystanders.
“Your children are as hungry as cannibals, and
as naked as savages. When the sun shines,
you thank the powers and lie still in your laziness——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s reason for that,” interrupted Dan.
“There are so many to do the work, we can’t
settle who is to begin; and so we’re content to
take no trouble; and this is the most your Rob
and Meg have learned of me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then when there comes a blank harvest,
you fight over one another’s graves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sure the powers forgive the sin,” cried Dan.
“Craving stomachs drive to blows, and then the
priest is merciful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“More merciful than you are to one another
when the fever comes, cruel savages as you are!
If your own mother took the fever, you would
turn her into a shed by the road side, and let her
tend herself. You would go quietly smoking
your pipe past the very place where your own
father lay dying, and never speak a word or move
a finger for him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis false as to not speaking a word. We
pray for them in the fever day and night; and
many’s the mass I have vowed against I grow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.115'>115</span>richer. The fever is a judgment of Heaven, and
where is the good of catching it if we can help it?
They that sent it will take care of them that have
it, and what is our care to theirs?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shame! shame!” was the cry from all sides;
and some who were on their way home with a
pan full of meal or a basket full of pease, stopped
to listen why.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shame! shame!” cried Dan, mimicking the
shouters. “You just don’t know what you’re
talking about; for them that have the fever don’t
cry shame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not in their hearts?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never a bit;—and don’t I know that had
an uncle in the fever twice, and moved him for
fear we should fall down in it too? Didn’t he
come crawling out the first time when we were
bringing a coffin and supposing him dead, and
did not he help the wail for himself before we
saw him among us? and would he have wailed
in a joke, if he had cried ‘Shame!’ in his heart?
and who such a judge as himself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What happened the next time, Dan?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The next time ’twas his ghost in earnest that
went to the burial; and a pretty burial it was.
O, there’s no place like old Ireland for care of
the dead! We beat you there entirely, you unnatural
ruffians, that never give so much as a
howl to your nearest flesh and blood!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The listeners thought it better and more natural
to help the living than to honour the dead.
It did not seem to occur to either party that it
was possible to do both. The dispute now ran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.116'>116</span>higher than ever, Murdoch laying the blame on
Dan of having made all his resources depend on
a favourable season, and Dan defending everything
Irish, down to poverty, famines, and pestilential
fevers; the first a perpetual, and each of
the others a frequent evil. A fight was beginning,
when order was restored by an authority
which might not be resisted. Mr. Mackenzie
was on board, having taken this opportunity of
visiting several islands which were under his
charge as a magistrate. Seeing the uproar on
the quay likely to increase every moment, he
stepped on shore, ordered two or three stout
men to part the combatants, and gave poor old
Murdoch into the care of Angus, who was standing
by, desiring that his wants should be supplied,
and that he should be sent home out of the
reach of provocation from Dan. Angus looked
kindly after the interests of his old master, now
so humbled as not to resist his help; and then
sent a neighbour with him to guard him from
robbery on his way home. It might have been
thought that Rob would have been the fittest
person to undertake this natural duty; but Rob
was nowhere to be seen. He had appeared one
of the first on the quay, and had bought a supply
of food with a little silver crucifix which he had
contrived to steal from Noreen, and which she
had kept, through all her distresses, as a sort of
charm. Rob was now hidden in a snug corner,
eating a portion of his provision, and drinking
the whiskey for which he had exchanged the
rest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.117'>117</span>Mr. Mackenzie accepted Angus’s invitation to
spend the night under his roof. He agreed all
the more readily from perceiving that he could
gratify the feelings of the parents by taking part
in the funeral of their child the next day; by
carrying his head to the grave, as the expression
is.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Mackenzie would know from Angus all
that he could tell of Murdoch’s history, and of
what had happened to Dan since he settled in
Garveloch. The present state of the island was
a subject which always made Angus melancholy.
The place was so changed, he said; there were
many people that you would scarcely believe to
be the same as before their distresses began.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such is always the case, Angus, where there
are more people than can live without jostling.
People act upon opposite maxims according to
their circumstances. If there is abundance for
every body, they are very ready to cry, ‘The
more the merrier;’ if the provision is scanty,
they mutter, ‘The fewer the better cheer,’ and
each snatches what he can for himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was at this moment distributing the evening
meal. At these very words she placed before
her son Kenneth a barley-cake,—the first
he had tasted for some time,—with a smile
which he well understood. He had known something
of the sufferings his mother had described
as the consequence of their mutual resolution not
to touch the food on which they usually subsisted;
but, till this evening, he had supposed the trial
only begun, and felt almost ashamed to be released
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.118'>118</span>so soon. As he broke his bread, a blush
overspread his whole face; and when he next
looked up, he met Ella’s eyes filled with tears.
Mr. Mackenzie observed, but did not understand;
and Angus himself would have found it difficult
to explain, though Kenneth’s altered looks caused
a suspicion that he had exercised more than his
share of self-denial.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have seen so much of the snatching you
speak of, and of defrauding too,” said Angus,
when all but himself and his guest had withdrawn,
“as to make me think we are now little better
off than in cities, compared with which I used to
think our island a paradise. There has, I believe,
been crime enough committed within the
circuit of a mile from this place, to match with
the alleys and cellars of a manufacturing city.
The malice of the people in their speech, the
envy in their countenances, the artifices in their
management, the violence of their actions, are
new to this place and these people. I hoped to
have kept my children out of sight and hearing
of these things for ever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never nourish such a hope, friend,” said Mr.
Mackenzie, “unless you can keep want out of
sight and hearing too. Virtue and vice depend
not on place, but on circumstance. The rich do
not steal in cities, any more than the starving
respect property in a retired island like this. If
we could increase our supply of necessaries and
comforts in proportion to the wants and reasonable
desires of all, there would be little vice;
and if we did no more than rightly estimate and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.119'>119</span>administer the resources we already possess, we
might destroy for ever the worst evils of which
society complains.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely, Sir, it might be done, if society were
but animated with one mind. It is in the power
of few, I suppose, to increase the supply of necessaries
and comforts perpetually and very extensively;
and no power on earth can do it so
as to keep pace with the constant demand for
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, if that demand be unchecked.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was going to say, Sir, that it is in the
power of every one to help to equalize the demand.
It seems to me, that whoever acts so as
to aggravate want, becomes answerable for the
evils caused by want, whether he injures his
neighbour’s capital, or neglects to improve his
own, or increases a demand upon it which is
already overwhelming.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will be told, friend, if you preach your
doctrine to unwilling ears, that one set of vices
would rage only the more fiercely for those which
result from want being moderated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know,” replied Angus, “that some are
of opinion that there is always a balance of vices
in society; that, as some are extinguished, others
arise. This seems to me a fancy that nobody
can prove or show to be reasonable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am quite of your opinion, Angus; and if
I were not, I am sure I should find it difficult to
assert that any set of vices could be more to be
dreaded than those which arise from extreme
poverty. I would not draw a comparison in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.120'>120</span>favour of any acknowledged vice over any other;
but I can conceive of no more dreadful degradation
of character, no more abundant sources of
misery, than arise out of the overpowering
temptations of want. You have seen instances,
I doubt not, among the lower, as I among the
higher classes, of the regular process by which
honourable feelings are blunted, kindly affections
embittered, piety turned into blasphemy,
and integrity into fraud and violence, as the
pressure of poverty becomes more and more
galling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have seen so much of this, Sir, as to make
me believe that very few, if any, pass through
the trial of squalid and hopeless poverty with
healthy minds. Moreover, I believe such poverty
to be the hot-bed of <em>all</em> vices. I shall never be
convinced, unless I see it, that any vice in existence
will be aggravated by the comforts of life
being extended to all, or that there is any which
is not encouraged by the feelings of personal
injury, of hatred towards their superiors, or
recklessness concerning their companions and
themselves, which are excited among the abject
or ferocious poor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Evil seems to be an admonition of Providence
to men to change that part of their conduct
which brings on that evil,” observed Mr.
Mackenzie; “and happy are they who take the
warning in time, or remember it for their future
guidance. Extensive fires warn men not to
build houses of wood; pestilence may teach
cleanliness and ventilation; and having thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.121'>121</span>given their lesson, these evils become rare, or
cease. What, therefore, may famine teach?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Care not to let eaters multiply beyond the
ordinary supply of food. I hope we people of
Garveloch shall take the warning. I am sure it
is distinct enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, Angus. You ate up the unusual supply
of two abundant seasons. An average one
produced hardship. An unfavourable one has
brought you to the brink of a famine. This is
Providence’s way of admonishing.”</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.</span><br /> <br /> TROUBLES NEVER COME ALONE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The sufferings of the islanders were not yet
over, as all foresaw who were accustomed to
watch the succession of events. The natural
consequence of a famine in former days was a
plague; and it is still too well known in Scotland
and Ireland that sickness follows scarcity. Garveloch
went through the natural process. There
never was such a winter known there as that
which succeeded the scarcity. Rheumatism
among the aged, consumption among the youthful,
all the disorders of infancy among the children,
laid waste the habitations of many who
thought they had never known sorrow till now.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.122'>122</span>Many a gray-haired matron, who used to sit
plying her distaff in the chimney-corner, and
singing old songs to the little ones playing about
her, had been shaken by the privations of the
summer, and now lay groaning in the torments
of the disease which was soon to take her hence,
although, with due care, so vigorous a life might
still have been preserved for a few years. Here,
a father who was anxious to be up and doing
for his children, on the sea or at the station, was
in danger of coughing his life away if he faced
the wintry air, and fretted in idleness within his
smoky cottage. There, a mother who had hungered
through many a day to feed her children,
now found that she had broken down her strength
in the effort, and that she must leave them to a
care less tender than her own. In other cases,
the parent and her little ones seemed hastening
together to another world, and two or three of
one family were buried in the same grave. The
mortality among the children was dreadful. The
widow Cuthbert could scarcely believe her own
happiness when she saw all her little family
daily seated at the board in rosy health and gay
spirits, when not a neighbour had been exempt
from loss. She would scarcely suffer her boys
out of her sight; and if accidentally parted from
them, trembled lest she should hear complaints
or see traces of illness when she met them again.
There had been sickness in Ella’s family, but
none died after little Jamie. Ronald kept watch
over them all. Many were the kind presents,
many the welcome indulgences he sent or carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.123'>123</span>to the sick members of his sister’s and brother’s
family this year. Katie needed no such assistance.
If she had, she would have freely accepted
it; but frequent inquiries and much friendly intercourse
served quite as well to show the regard
these friends bore to each other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The supplies of food were still so precarious
as to make every body anxious except those who
could purchase a store. Now and then a boat
with provisions came from a distance, and the
cod-fishing turned out tolerably productive to
those who had health and strength to pursue the
occupation. So much was wanted, however, for
immediate consumption, that business nearly
stood still at the station. Kenneth had been
recalled thither when there seemed to be a prospect
of employment for him; but he had now
made the last barrel that would be wanted before
next season, and began to be very melancholy.
He sauntered along the pier, around which there
was no busy traffic; he lounged about the cooperage,
taking up first one tool and then another,
and wondering when the hammer and the saw
would be heard there again. Many a time did
he count the weeks that must pass before he
should be once more earning his maintenance,
and reckon how large was the debt to his uncle
which he was incurring by his present uselessness.
Ronald could not succeed in making him
cheerful for a day together, or in inducing him
to employ himself; and he began to fear that
either illness was creeping on the young man, or
that his fine spirit was broken by the anxiety he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.124'>124</span>had undergone and the miseries he had beheld.
He would have sent him over to Ella, whose
influence was all-powerful with her son; but
Ella had cares enough at home just now. Having
messages from Kenneth as frequently as
usual, she was not more than usually anxious
concerning him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angus’s activity and cheerfulness never gave
way. He ascribed their power to his wife’s influence;
while she found a never-failing support
to her energies when he was present. She
owned to Katie how easily she could give way
to despondency when he was absent for days
together, and how she felt strong enough to do
and bear anything when his boat came in sight
again. The fact was, they did owe to each other
all they believed they owed. There was a lofty
spirit of trust in Ella, as animating to her husband
as his experience in life and devotion to his
home were supporting to her. Katie looked with
a generous sympathy on the enjoyment of a
happiness of which she had been deprived, and
wished no more for herself than that she might
be as secure from trials with her children as she
believed Angus and Ella to be. No sorrows
could, she told Ella, be inflicted by the children
of such parents—by children so brought up as
theirs. Ella never admitted this assurance without
reservation; for she knew too much of
human life to expect that any one of its blessings
should be enjoyed for ever without alloy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was during the absence of her husband on
one of his trading excursions that the children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.125'>125</span>came crowding round the door, to ask Ella to
come and listen to the new music some gentlemen
in fine clothes were playing as they went
up the pass. Katie was brought out by her little
people at the same moment. The children
climbed the height to get another view of the
strangers, and their mothers followed. A recruiting
party was ascending between the rocks
at the same moment that more companies than
one were leaving the burying-ground. The
children clapped their hands and began to dance
to the booming drum and the shrill fife; but
Ella immediately stopped them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t ye mark,” she said, “there’s Rob and
Meg Murdoch coming down the hill? Would
ye like to see anybody dancing in your sight
when you have just laid your father’s head in the
ground?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I saw Rob drunk this very morn, mother,
and he danced as if his father had been there
looking on.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If Rob behaves as if he had no feeling, that
is no reason why you should seem to think he
has none.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look at Meg!” cried another child. “She
is laughing as if it was a bridal instead of a
funeral.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was shocked, though not much surprised,
to see Meg run forward to meet the soldiers, as
if they were old acquaintance, and linger behind
with them when her party, including her stupid
brother, had cracked their joke and passed on.
It occurred to her that Meg’s brother-in-law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.126'>126</span>might be among the soldiers and she said so by
way of excuse; but immediately called the children
down from the height, unwilling that such
an example of unfeeling levity should remain
before their eyes. They were naturally somewhat
unwilling to lose sight of the scarlet coats,
having never beheld any before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye will see such often enough, now, my
dears,” said their mother, sighing. “These
people know how to choose their time. The
fife is ever merriest when the heart’s music is
hushed; and whenever people are at their wit’s
end with want and sorrow, the red-coats come
and carry away such as are glad to drown
thought and seek change instead of waiting
for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, indeed,” replied Katie: “a funeral at
the top of the hill, and a recruiting party going
to meet it, is natural enough; and so it would
have been to see lads made to drink in the
king’s name when their stomachs were craving
food. I wondered we had had no recruiting
before; for the worse the times, the more are
ready to leave home behind them, and go and
serve the king.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The children understood nothing of all this
but that they should see the soldiers again,
which indeed was the point which most concerned
them at their age. They listened long
for the drum—they took turns as scouts to watch
which way the soldiers went, and to give notice
if they should approach. Now they were traced
up to Duff’s farm, heard to play before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.127'>127</span>door, and seen to be invited in. After a while,
they proceeded with a few followers at their
heels, by a roundabout way to the Murdochs’
cove. Meg was their guide, walking in front,
arm-in-arm with a soldier—a fashion of marching
to which it was supposed she had been just
drilled. The music being heard approaching
behind the rocks, the children scampered off to
meet it; and after a considerable time, during
which shouts arose which made the mothers
wish their boys at home again, the children
appeared as the advanced guard of the procession,
waving their bonnets, and pretending
to march like the grand folks behind them. It
was soon apparent that all present were not as
happy as they. Meg indeed laughed so as to be
heard above the music, and one or two raw lads
looked full of pride and heroism, and took off
their bonnets from time to time to look at the
gay ribbons with which they were ornamented;
but all the bustle and noise—nothing remarkable
perhaps in an English city, but very astonishing
in Garveloch—could not call off attention from
a woman’s rage, or drown the screams of a
woman’s scolding voice. The vixen was Noreen;
and if ever a vixen had an excuse for her
violence, it was she at this moment; for Dan,
the husband for whom she had, as she declared,
left the beautifullest home of the beautifullest
country in the world—Dan, whom she had defended
through thick and thin, for having “kilt”
her and “murthered” her “babbies,”—Dan, who
had said so often that a man needed nothing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.128'>128</span>life more than a cabin and a potato-ground, and
an “iligant” wife, had enlisted, and was going
to leave her and her last remaining child to
starve. Had not he a cabin? she wanted to
know; and had not he a potato-ground, as
good as any at Rathmullin? and had not he
called her his “iligant Noreen” before the fancy
came across him to break her heart?</p>

<p class='c001'>Since it did not please Dan to answer her
questions, no one else was bound to do so. It
was difficult to say whether he was drunk or not.
He kissed his wife in return for her cuffs, and
behaved like a madman; but such was his way
when he was roused to mirth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shocked at the sight, Ella was about to withdraw,
when Katie expressed her wonder whether
this scene was to be acted in all the islands.
She had connexions in more than one, and
began to be anxious lest some of them should
be tempted to go abroad. Ella therefore accosted
the sergeant, a goodnatured-looking man,
and asked if his recruiting was likely to be prosperous
among the islands? He found the
people very loyal, he replied, and many fine young
men ready to serve their king and country. He
should visit every place in the district in turn,
and had already made a pretty wide circuit. He
had this morning come from Islay.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You would scarce enlist many there,” observed
Ella. “A few months ago would have
been your best time for Islay; now the fishery
begins to open a prospect again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I beg your pardon, madam; we have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.129'>129</span>particularly successful in Islay.” And he pulled
out a list of names, displayed it hastily, and was
about to put it up again, when Katie snatched it,
and after the first glance looked at her friend
with such a gaze of anguish as at once told Ella
the truth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is Kenneth’s name there?” she asked, in
a low, hoarse voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That young man,” said the sergeant, who
had been speaking to one of his people, and did
not perceive Ella’s emotion, “that young man
to whose name you point—and a very fine youth
he is, six feet and half an inch—belongs to this
place. He is to come over this afternoon to
take leave of his family, and proceeds with me
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella retreated hastily towards her own door;
she turned round on reaching the threshold, and
motioned to Katie not to follow her; but Katie
would not be repulsed. With streaming eyes
she attempted to make her way by gentle force.
Ella recovered her power of speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Leave me, Katie. I can speak to no one but
Angus. O Angus! why are you away? O!
how shall I tell the news when he comes back?”</p>

<p class='c001'>When Katie had led her friend into the inner
room, she left her to her grief, thinking that the
best kindness was to keep watch that no one intruded.
The widow felt as if her own heart
was bursting when audible tokens once or twice
reached her of the fearful conflict which rent the
mother’s heart. In the fervour of her love and
compassion for Ella, she was full of indignation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.130'>130</span>against him who had caused all this misery; and
when this indignation had reached its highest
pitch, the latch of the door was uplifted, and
Kenneth stood before her. His pale countenance,
with its expression of mournful determination,
might have disarmed her anger at a
moment of less excitement; but Katie would
not bestow on him a second glance or a greeting.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where is my mother?” he inquired. “My
father, I find, is absent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Seek her yourself,” replied Katie, pointing
to the chamber. “If you did not fear to wring
her heart, you will scarce shrink from seeing her
grief.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She knows then!” said Kenneth. “I
would fain have told her myself——”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You need not covet the task,” replied Katie,
her features working convulsively. “You would
have cast yourself into the sea before now if you
had seen her take the tidings.” And the widow
gave vent to what was boiling in her mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth did not at first interrupt her; and
when he attempted explanation, was not allowed
to proceed. Katie had never before been so
unreasonable as now on her friend’s behalf.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Make way!” said Kenneth, at length, in
strong emotion. “My mother will hear me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella at this moment threw open the door of
the chamber, and stood, still trembling but erect,
and spoke calmly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Katie!” she said, “I thought you had
known Kenneth and me better. He has ever
been dutiful: why then condemn him unheard?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.131'>131</span>I have told you my confidence in him; and is it
kind, then, to make a mockery of my trust?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Katie’s anger was now all turned against herself.
She cast an imploring look at them both,
and rushed out of the house before they could
detain her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bless you, mother, for trusting me!” cried
Kenneth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But O, my boy, what a sore trial to my
trust! What has possessed ye, Kenneth, that
ye must leave us? When we have suffered together
so long, and were beginning to hope
together again, what could make ye plunge us
into a new trouble?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was hastily done, mother, but done for
the best, and not from discontent with home, or
a love of wandering. I could not see so clearly
as you that times are about to mend. I could
not endure to be a burden to uncle Ronald, and
my heart was sick with hoping and hoping,
and finding nothing to do after all. Then
there are so many brothers growing up to
fill my place; and my going will make room
for one of them at the station. And then there
was the bounty too. I thought I should have
had pleasure, mother, in giving you the first purse
of money I ever had; but nothing will give me
any pleasure again if you think I have been
wilfully wrong.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not wilfully wrong, Kenneth; I never
thought you could be that—not even in the first
moment when——”</p>

<p class='c001'>She could not proceed. Her son continued:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.132'>132</span>“I would fain hear ye say more, mother. O,
can ye tell me that you think me right?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not let it weigh with you, my son, whether
I think you judged rightly or not. You
felt dutifully and kindly, and you have as much
right to judge of your duty as I. You shall
never want my blessing nor your father’s. It is
to your wish to do your duty that we give our
blessing; and it will therefore follow you over
the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kenneth had much to say on duty to one’s
country, and on the question who could best be
spared to serve in her armies; in the pursuit of
which argument he brought the proof round to
himself. His mother, feeling that the deed
could not be undone, encouraged his feelings of
patriotism, sanctioned his desire to fulfil a public
duty, and contented herself with the silence of
dissent when she thought him mistaken.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mother,” cried Kenneth, at length, bursting
into tears, “you make a child of me by treating
me like a man. I knew you would be patient,
I knew you would be indulgent, but I scarcely
hoped that even you could so soon, so very soon,
give me the rights I have been so hasty to claim.
If you had blamed me, if you had spoken with
authority, I could have commanded myself better
when it comes to the last.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are all weak,” murmured Ella, melting
also into tears. “God forbid we should judge
one another! We are least of all fit to do so
when our griefs are tossing so as to wreck our
judgments. Authority, Kenneth! No; this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.133'>133</span>not the time for me to use it. If it were merely
whether ye should cross to Islay to-day or to-morrow,
I might have spoken unawares with
authority; but when the question is, what your
duty in life is to be, and when that question is
already decided, all that a mother can do is to
give her blessing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The many dreary hours of this night were too
few for what had to be said and done by the
elder members of this mourning family. Soon
after daybreak Angus returned; so that Kenneth
had not the additional misery of departing in
uncertainty whether he should be followed by
his father’s blessing. Angus had in his young
days been sent abroad by a spirit of adventure;
so that he was even better prepared than Ella to
sympathise in Kenneth’s feelings and convictions.
He commanded himself when the event
was first told him; accompanied his son to a
considerable distance; and from the hour of his
return spoke to none but Ella of the blank the
wanderer’s absence caused, or of the anxiety
with which he watched for tidings of the war.</p>

<hr class='c019' />
<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chapter X.</span><br /> <br /> CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p class='c015'>A recruiting party was, as Ella had foretold, a
frequent sight in Garveloch as long as the distress
lasted; and one of the present consequences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.134'>134</span>to her and her husband of the favourable
season which followed was, that the red-coats
ceased to appear, and the hated sound of the
drum and fife to make them start. As soon as the
fishery was resumed, there was work enough for
all who remained on the island, and therefore
little encouragement to serve the king out of his
own dominions. News of Kenneth came very
rarely—about as often as rejoicings for a victory.
Some of Angus’s neighbours were wont
to come and tell him of such events as if they
were certain of bringing welcome news, provided
he knew that his son was safe. Fergus’s lads,
especially, who regretted that they were too
young to enlist at the same time with Kenneth,
seemed disposed to take the first opportunity of
doing so that might occur, and to have no doubt
that the best service they could render to their
island was to leave it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How can you suppose,” said Angus to
them one day, “that I can rejoice in the slaughter
you tell me of? How can you imagine it
can give me pleasure to look forward to our
strong youths leaving our shores?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought, uncle,” said one—“I am sure I
heard somebody say you believed that we wanted
thinning, and that war must therefore be a very
good thing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I said so,” said Captain Forbes, who stood
within hearing. “You think, Angus, that there
are too many people for the supply of food; and
therefore the more that die, the better cheer
there is for those who remain. Did you not tell
Mr. Mackenzie so?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3.135'>135</span>“Better say at once, sir, that we ought to
pray for a pestilence. Better send for our enemies
to slaughter us as fast as they can, sparing
only a proper number to enjoy what we leave
behind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I am sure you used to complain of our
numbers, Angus, and ascribe our distress to
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it does not follow, sir, that I would
have them removed by violence. All I wish is,
that society should be as happy as it can be
made; and it would be somewhat strange to
inflict the extremest misery with this view. I
never had such a thought, I assure you, as of
running into a greater evil to avoid a lesser.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many people, however, think occasional
wars and plagues very good things to keep down
the population.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I have heard, but I think very differently.
The one circumstance which, above all others,
cheers me respecting the state of society, is that
population is, to a considerable extent, checked
by better means than formerly. There are
fewer lives lost by war, plagues, and the accidents
of common life, while the increase of
population is not in proportion to the removal of
these dreadful checks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you account for this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Marriage is less general, and takes place at
a later age—at least among the middling classes,
whose example will, I trust, be soon followed by
their poorer neighbours. Whenever any one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.136'>136</span>class gains a clear understanding of the reasons
why a thing has been, and why it should no
longer be, there is room for hope that other
classes will in time enter into their views, and
act accordingly. There is hope that governments
will in time cease to make war and
encourage population,—that is, to call people
into existence for the purpose of cutting one
another’s throat. There is hope that the poor
will in time be more eager to maintain than to
multiply their families; and then, lads, there
will be no more drumming and fifing in Garveloch,
and no need to wander abroad in search
of danger and death, in order to show patriotism.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When will that be, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am no prophet; but I will venture to prophesy
that it will happen somewhere between the
third and the thirty-thousandth generation from
the present—that is, that it will take place, but
not yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have said a great deal,” observed the
captain, “about the reasons why there should
no longer be want; but you slipped quietly
enough over the reason why there has ever been
want.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was not my intention to do so,” said
Angus, smiling, “for it appears very clear to me.
It was growing need which urged men towards
all the improvements which have ever taken
place. The appropriation and security of property,
improvements in government, art, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.137'>137</span>sciences—in short, all the institutions of society
took their beginning from the growing wants of
men; and those growing wants were caused, of
course, by increase of numbers. This is quite
enough to satisfy us that the principle of increase
is a good one; while, if we see that our institutions
can now be preserved and improved under
other and higher kinds of stimulus, it is time that
we were controlling the principle within the
bounds of reason and happiness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is done for us when we do not look to it
ourselves,” the captain replied, sighing as he cast
a glance around him. “How full is the burying-ground,—how
empty are the houses compared
with what they were but a few months ago! It
reminds me of some of the places in the east,
where we were ordered to march in the rear of
the plague. They will soon be filled again, if
the fishery does well. That is a comfort.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And it reminds me that I have no time to
lose,” observed Angus. “Will you be my passenger
to the station, captain?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nobody had time to lose this season in the
island, but those who were willing to run the
risk of future scarcity. Labour was in great
request, and, of course, well paid. Angus found
ample employment for his crane, and received
very good interest for the capital laid out upon
it. His younger sons worked it with as much
zeal as Kenneth had shown in its construction;
but their father, proud as he was of them, thought
in his inmost heart that no other of his flourishing
tribe equalled the eldest, or could make up for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.138'>138</span>his loss; and the haunting dream of the night,
the favourite vision of the day, was of Kenneth’s
return, to leave his native land no more. This
was Angus’s meditation while plying the oar,
and this his theme in his own chimney corner.
It was much to hear of Kenneth’s honour and
welfare, but while no hope of peace came with
the tidings, they were not perfectly satisfying.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only person to whom the improvement in
the times brought any trouble was the widow
Cuthbert. Her former lovers—not Ronald, but
those who had broken off acquaintance with her
when her young family seemed a dead weight in
the scale against her own charms—now returned,
and were more earnest than ever in their suit.
Katie had discretion enough to be aware that
the only respect in which she had become a more
desirable match than before was in the growth of
her boys, whose labour might soon be a little
fortune to her, if she chose so to employ it.
She was therefore far from being flattered at
becoming so much in request, and honoured and
valued the disinterested friendship of Ronald
more than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>The present time, even with the drawback of
Kenneth’s absence, was the happiest period of
Ronald’s life. He made his little home at the
station sociable and comfortable, by gathering
his nephews and nieces about him; and his visits
to Garveloch became more frequent and more
welcome continually when his prosperous business
allowed him leisure for the trip. Fergus,
weighed down with care, had grown old before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3.139'>139</span>his time; and to Ronald’s assistance it was
owing that his family preserved their respectability
till the lads were able to take on themselves
a part of the charge which had been too heavy
for their father.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ella was the last of the family to show the
marks of change. Her mind and heart were as
remarkable for their freshness in age as they had
been for their dignity in youth. Inured to early
exertion and hardship, she was equal to all calls
upon her energies of body and spirit. She was
still seen, as occasion required, among the rocks,
or on the sea, or administering her affairs at
home. She was never known to plead infirmity,
or to need forbearance, or to disappoint expectation.
She had all she wanted in her husband’s
devotion to her and to his home, and she distributed
benefits untold from the rich treasury of
her warm affections. She had, from childhood,
filled a station of authority, and had never
abused her power, but made it the means of
living for others. Her power increased with
every year of her life, and with it grew her
scrupulous watchfulness over its exercise, till
the same open heart, penetrating eye, and ready
hand, which had once made her the sufficient
dependence of her orphan brothers, gave her an
extensive influence over the weal and woe of
Garveloch.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'><i>Summary of Principles illustrated in this volume.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c026'>The increase of population is necessarily limited by the
means of subsistence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since successive portions of capital yield a less and less
return, and the human species produce at a constantly
accelerated rate, there is a perpetual tendency in population
to press upon the means of subsistence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ultimate checks by which population is kept down
to the level of the means of subsistence are vice and
misery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since the ends of life are virtue and happiness, these
checks ought to be superseded by the milder methods
which exist within man’s reach.</p>

<p class='c001'>These evils may be delayed by promoting the increase
of capital, and superseded by restraining the increase of
population.</p>

<p class='c001'>Towards the one object, a part of society may do a little;
towards the other, all may do much.</p>

<p class='c001'>By rendering property secure, expenditure frugal, and
production easy, society may promote the growth of capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>By bringing no more children into the world than there
is a subsistence provided for, society may preserve itself
from the miseries of want. In other words, the timely use
of the mild preventive check may avert the horrors of any
positive check.</p>

<p class='c001'>The preventive check becomes more, and the positive
checks less powerful, as society advances.</p>

<p class='c001'>The positive checks, having performed their office in
stimulating the human faculties and originating social institutions,
must be wholly superseded by the preventive check
before society can attain its ultimate aim—the greatest happiness
of the greatest number.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
